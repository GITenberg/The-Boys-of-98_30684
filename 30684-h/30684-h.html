<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At or about eleven o’clock on the morning of
January 25th the United States battle-ship
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> steamed through the narrow channel which
gives entrance to the inner harbour of Havana, and
came to anchor at Buoy No. 4, in obedience to orders
from the captain of the port, in from five and one-half
to six fathoms of water. She swung at her cables
within five hundred yards of the arsenal, and about
two hundred yards distant from the floating dock.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Very shortly afterward the rapid-firing guns on her
bow roared out a salute as the Spanish colours were
run up to the mizzenmast-head, and this thunderous
announcement of friendliness was first answered by
Morro Castle, followed a few moments later by the
Spanish cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Alphonso XII.</span></span> and a German
school-ship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reverberations had hardly ceased before the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg 2]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>captain of the port and an officer from the Spanish
war-vessel, each in his gaily decked launch, came alongside
the battle-ship in accordance with the rules of
naval etiquette.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lieut. John J. Blandin, officer of the deck, received
the visitors at the head of the gangway and escorted
them to the captain’s cabin. A few moments later
came an officer from the German ship, and the courtesies
of welcoming the Americans were at an end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> was an armoured, twin-screw battle-ship of
the second class, 318 feet in length, 57 feet in breadth,
with a draught of 21 feet, 6 inches; of 6,648 tons displacement,
with engines of 9,293 indicated horse-power,
giving her a speed of 17.75 knots. She was built in
the Brooklyn navy yard, according to act of Congress,
August 3, 1886. Work on her was commenced October
11, 1888; she was launched November 18, 1890,
and put into commission September 17, 1895. She
was built after the designs of chief constructor T. D.
Wilson. The delay in going into commission is said
to have been due to the difficulty in getting satisfactory
armour. The side armour was twelve inches thick;
the two steel barbettes were each of the same thickness,
and the walls of the turrets were eight inches
thick.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In her main battery were four 10-inch and six
6-inch breech-loading rifles; in the secondary battery
seven 6-pounder and eight 1-pounder rapid-fire
guns and four Gatlings. Her crew was made up of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3">[pg 3]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>370 men, and the following officers: Capt. C. D.
Sigsbee, Lieut.-Commander R. Wainwright, Lieut. G.
F. W. Holman, Lieut. J. Hood, Lieut. C. W. Jungen,
Lieut. G. P. Blow, Lieut. F. W. Jenkins, Lieut. J. J.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Why had the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> been sent to this port?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The official reason given by the Secretary of the
Navy when he notified the Spanish minister, Señor
Dupuy de Lome, was that the visit of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> was
simply intended as a friendly call, according to the
recognised custom of nations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The United States minister at Madrid, General
Woodford, also announced the same in substance to
the Spanish Minister of State.

at Madrid that a state of war did not exist in
Cuba, and that the relations between the United States
and Spain were of the most friendly character, nothing
less could be done than accept the official construction
put upon the visit.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spanish public, however, were not disposed to
view the matter in the same light, as may be seen by
the following extracts from newspapers:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If the government of the United States sends one
war-ship to Cuba, a thing it is no longer likely to do,
Spain would act with energy and without vacillation.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">El
Heraldo, January 16th.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We see now the eagerness of the Yankees to seize
Cuba.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Imparcial, January 23d.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same paper, on the 27th, declared:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If Havana people, exasperated at American impudence
in sending the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span>, do some rash, disagreeable
thing, the civilised world will know too well who
is responsible. The American government must know
that the road it has taken leads to war between both
nations.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On January 25th Madrid newspapers made general
comment upon the official explanation of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine’s</span></span>
visit to Havana, and agreed in expressing the opinion
that her visit is <span class="tei tei-q">“inopportune and calculated to encourage
the insurgents.”</span> It was announced that,
<span class="tei tei-q">“following Washington’s example,”</span> the Spanish government
will <span class="tei tei-q">“instruct Spanish war-ships to visit a
few American ports.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Imparcial</span></span> expresses fear that the despatch of
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> to Havana will provoke a conflict, and adds:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Europe cannot doubt America’s attitude towards

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epocha</span></span> asks if the despatch of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> to
Havana is <span class="tei tei-q">“intended as a sop to the Jingoes,”</span> and
adds:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We cannot suppose the American government so
naïve or badly informed as to imagine that the presence
of American war-vessels at Havana will be a cause of
satisfaction to Spain or an indication of friendship.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The people of the United States generally believed
that the battle-ship had been sent to Cuba because
of the disturbances existing in the city of Havana,
which seemingly threatened the safety of Americans
there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the morning of January 12th what is termed
the <span class="tei tei-q">“anti-liberal outbreak”</span> occurred in the city of
Havana.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Officers of the regular and volunteer forces headed
the ultra-Spanish element in an attack upon the leading
liberal newspaper offices, because, as alleged, of
Captain-General Blanco’s refusal to authorise the suppression
of the liberal press. It was evidently a riotous
protest against Spain’s policy of granting autonomy to
the Cubans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mob, gathered in such numbers as to be for the
time being most formidable, indulged in open threats
against Americans, and it was believed by the public
generally that American interests, and the safety of
citizens of the United States in Havana, demanded the
protection of a war-vessel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The people of Havana received the big fighting ship
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>impassively. Soldiers, sailors, and civilians gathered at
the water-front as spectators, but no word, either of
threat or friendly greeting, was heard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the city the American residents experienced a
certain sense of relief because now a safe refuge was
provided in case of more serious rioting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the officers and crew of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> were apprehensive
regarding their situation there can be little
doubt. During the first week after the arrival of the
battle-ship several of the sailors wrote to friends or
relatives expressing fears as to what might be the
result of the visit, and on the tenth of February one of
the lieutenants is reported as having stated:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If we don’t get away from here soon there will be
trouble.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The customary ceremonial visits on shore were made
by the commander of the ship and his staff, and, so
far as concerned the officials of the city, the Americans
were seemingly welcome visitors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The more radical of the citizens were not so apparently
content with seeing the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> in their harbour.
Within a week after the arrival of the ship incendiary
circulars were distributed in the streets, on the railway
cars, and in many other public places, calling upon all
Spaniards to avenge the <span class="tei tei-q">“insult”</span> of the battle-ship’s
visit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A translation of one such circular serves as a specimen of all:

At eight o’clock on the evening of February 15th
all the magazines aboard the battle-ship were closed,
and the keys delivered to her commander according
to the rules of the service.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An hour and a half later Lieut. John J. Blandin was
on watch as officer of the deck; Captain Sigsbee sat in
his cabin writing letters; on the starboard side of the
ship, made fast to the boom, was the steam cutter, with
her crew on board waiting to make the regular ten
o’clock trip to the shore to bring off such of the officers
or crew as were on leave of absence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The night was unusually dark; great banks of thick
clouds hung over the city and harbour; the ripple of
the waves against the hulls of the vessels at anchor,
and the subdued hum of voices, alone broke the silence.
The lights here and there, together with the dark tracery
of spar and cordage against the sky, was all
that betokened the presence of war-ship or peaceful
merchantman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suddenly, and when the silence was most profound, the
watch on board the steamer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">City of Washington</span></span>, and
some sailors ashore, saw what appeared to be a sheet
of fire flash up in the water directly beneath the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span>,
and even as the blinding glare was in their eyes came a
mighty, confused rumble as of grinding and rending,
followed an instant later by a roar as if a volcano had
sprung into activity beneath the waves of the harbour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then was flung high in the air what might be
likened to a shaft of fire filled with fragments of iron,
wood, and human flesh, rising higher and higher until
its force was spent, when it fell outwardly as falls a
column of water broken by the wind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earth literally trembled; the air suddenly became
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>heavy with stifling smoke. Electric lights on shore were
extinguished; the tinkling of breaking glass could be
heard everywhere in that portion of the city nearest the
harbour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the shower of fragments and of fire ceased to
fall a dense blackness enshrouded the harbour, from the
midst of which could be heard cries of agony, appeals
for help, and the shouts of those who, even while
struggling to save their own lives, would cheer their
comrades.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After this, and no man could have said how many
seconds passed while the confusing, bewildering blackness
lay heavy over that scene of death and destruction,
long tongues of flame burst up from the torn and
splintered decks of the doomed battle-ship, a signal of
distress, as well as a beacon for those who would
succour the dying.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Captain Sigsbee, recovering in the briefest space of
time from the bewilderment of the shock, ran out of
the cabin toward the deck, groping his way as best he
might in the darkness through the long passage until
he came upon the marine orderly, William Anthony,
who was at his post of duty near the captain’s quarters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was a moment full of horror all the more intense
because unknown, but the soldier, mindful even then
of his duty, saluting, said in the tone of one who makes
an ordinary report:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sir, I have to inform you that the ship has been
blown up, and is sinking.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Follow me,”</span> the captain replied, acknowledging
his subordinate’s salute, and the two pressed forward
through the blackness and suffocating vapour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lieutenant Blandin, officer of the deck, was sitting
on the starboard side of the quarter-deck when the
terrible upheaval began, and was knocked down by a
piece of cement hurled from the lowermost portion of
the ship’s frame, perhaps; but, leaping quickly to his
feet, he ran to the poop that he might be at his proper
station when the supreme moment came.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lieut. Friend W. Jenkins was in the junior officers’
mess-room when the first of a battle-ship’s death-throes
was felt, and as soon as possible made his way toward
the deck, encouraging some of the bewildered marines
to make a brave fight for life; but he never joined his
comrades.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Assistant Engineer Darwin R. Merritt and Naval
Cadet Boyd together ran toward the hatch, but only
to find the ladder gone. Boyd climbed through, and
then did his best to aid Merritt; but his efforts were
vain, and the engineer went down with his ship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seemed as if only the merest fraction of time
elapsed before the uninjured survivors were gathered
on the poop-deck. Forward of them, where a moment
previous had been the main-deck, was a huge mass
looming up in the darkness like some threatening
promontory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the starboard quarter hung the gig, and opposite
her, on the port side, was the barge.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the first two or three seconds only muffled,
gurgling, choking exclamations were heard indistinctly;
and then, when the terrible vibrations of the air ceased,
cries for help went up from every quarter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lieutenant Blandin says, in describing those few but
terrible moments:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Captain Sigsbee ordered that the gig and the
launch be lowered, and the officers and men, who by
this time had assembled, got the boats out and rescued
a number in the water.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Captain Sigsbee ordered Lieut.-Commander Wainwright
forward to see the extent of the damage, and if
anything could be done to rescue those forward, or to
extinguish the flames which followed close upon the
explosion and burned fiercely as long as there were
any combustibles above water to feed them.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lieut.-Commander Wainwright on his return reported
the total and awful character of the calamity,
and Captain Sigsbee gave the last sad order, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Abandon
ship,’</span> to men overwhelmed with grief indeed, but calm
and apparently unexcited.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The quiet, yet at the same time sharp, words of
command from the captain aroused his officers from
the stupefaction of horror which had begun to creep
over them, and this handful of men, who even then
were standing face to face with death, set about aiding
their less fortunate companions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As soon as they could be manned, boats put off from
the vessels in the harbour, and the work of rescue was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>continued until all the torn and mangled bodies in
which life yet remained had been taken from the water.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Capt. H. H. Woods, of the British steamer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Thurston</span></span>,
was among the first in this labour of mercy, and concerning
it he says:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“My vessel was within half a mile of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span>,
and my small boat was the first to gain the wreck.
It is beyond my power to describe the explosion. It
was awful. It paralysed the intellect for a few moments.
The cries that came over the water awakened us to a
realisation that some great tragedy had occurred.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I made all haste to the wreck. There were very
few men in the water. All told, I do not believe there
were thirty. We picked up some of them and passed
them on to other vessels, and then continued our work
of rescue.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The sight was appalling. Dismembered legs and
trunks of bodies were floating about, together with
pieces of clothing, boxes of meats, and all sorts of
wreckage. Now and then the agonised cry of some
poor suffering fellow could be heard above the tumult.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One grand figure stood out in all the terrible scene.
That was Captain Sigsbee. Every American has reason
to be proud of that officer. He seemed to have realised
in an instant all that happened. Not for a moment did
he show evidence of excitement. He alone was cool.
Discipline? Why, man, the discipline was there as
strong as ever, despite the fact that all around was
death and disaster.”</span>

Calmly, with the same observance of etiquette as if
they had been assisting at some social function, the
officers took their respective places in the boats, and,
amid a silence born of deepest grief, rowed a short
distance from the rent and riven mass so lately their
post of duty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A gentleman from Chicago, a guest at the Grand

<span class="tei tei-q">“It was followed by another and a much louder one,”</span>
    he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“We thought the whole city had been blown

the tableware.

When morning came the wreck was the central

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
War between two nations does not begin suddenly.
The respective governments are exceedingly
ceremonious before opening the <span class="tei tei-q">“game of death,”</span>
and it is not to be supposed that the United States
commenced hostilities immediately after the disaster to
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> in the harbour of Havana.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To tell the story of the war which ensued, without
first giving in regular order the series of events which
marked the preparations for hostilities, would be much
like relating an adventure without explaining why the
hero was brought into the situation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is admitted that, as a rule, details, and especially
those of a political nature, are dry reading; but once
take into consideration the fact that they all aid in
giving a clearer idea of how one nation begins hostilities
with another, and much of the tediousness may be
forgiven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Just previous to the disaster to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span>, during
the last <a name="corr019" id="corr019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">days</span> of <span class="tei tei-corr">January</span> or the first of February, Señor Enrique
Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish minister at Washington,
wrote a private letter to the editor of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Madrid <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Herald</span></span>, Señor Canalejas, who was his intimate
friend, in which he made some uncomplimentary remarks
regarding the President of the United States,
and intimated that Spain was not sincere in certain
commercial negotiations which were then being carried
on between the two countries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By some means, not yet fully explained, certain
Cubans got possession of this letter, and caused it to
be published in the newspapers. Señor de Lome did
not deny having written the objectionable matter; but
claimed that, since it was a private communication, it
should not affect him officially. The Secretary of
State instructed General Woodford, our minister at
Madrid, to demand that the Spanish government immediately
recall Minister de Lome, and to state that, if he
was not relieved from duty within twenty-four hours,
the President would issue to him his passports, which
is but another way of ordering a foreign minister out
of the country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">February 9.</span></span> Señor de Lome made all haste to resign,
and the resignation was accepted by his government
before—so it was claimed by the Spanish authorities—President
McKinley’s demand for the recall was
received.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">February 15.</span></span> The de Lome incident was a political
matter which caused considerable diplomatic correspondence;
but it was overshadowed when the battle-ship
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> was blown up in the harbour of
Havana.

As has already been said, the United States government
at once ordered a court of inquiry to ascertain
the cause of the disaster, and this, together with the
search for the bodies of the drowned crew, was prosecuted
with utmost vigour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Very many of the people in the United States
believed that Spanish officials were chargeable with the
terrible crime, while those who were not disposed to
make such exceedingly serious accusation insisted that
the Spanish government was responsible for the safety
of the vessel,—that she had been destroyed by outside
agencies in a friendly harbour. In the newspapers, on
the streets, in all public places, the American people
spoke of the possibility of war, and the officials of the
government set to work as if, so it would seem, they also
were confident there would be an open rupture between
the two nations.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">February 28.</span></span> In Congress, Representative Gibson

sailed from Gibraltar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the end of February the work of preparing the
vessels at the different navy yards for sea was being
pushed forward with the utmost rapidity, and munitions
of war were distributed hurriedly among the forts and
fortifications, as if the officials of the War Department
believed that hostilities might be begun at any moment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor was it only within the borders of this country
that such preparations were making. A despatch from
Shanghai to London reported that the United States

At about the same time came news from Spain
telling that the Spanish were making ready for hostilities.

torpedo-boat destroyers. The cruisers <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oquendo</span></span> and <a name="corr022" id="corr022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr"><span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span></span>,

of about three hundred tons each, and eighteen vessels
of two hundred and fifty tons each.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

every direction.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the early days of March, Señor Gullon,
Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, intimated to
Minister Woodford that the Spanish government
desired the recall from Havana of Consul-General
Lee.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spain also intimated that the American war-ships,
which had been designated to convey supplies to
Cuba for the relief of the sufferers there, should be
replaced by merchant vessels, in order to deprive the
assistance sent to the reconcentrados of an official
character.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Minister Woodford cabled such requests to the
government at Washington, to which it replied by
refusing to recall General Lee under the present circumstances,
or to countermand the orders for the
despatch of war-vessels, making the representation
that relief vessels are not fighting ships.
</p>

He had borne himself, so it was stated from the
White House, throughout the crisis with judgment,
fidelity, and courage, to the President’s entire satisfaction.
As to supplies for the relief of the Cuban
people, all arrangements had been made to carry consignments
at once from Key West by one of the naval

thus distributed:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An additional tax on beer of one dollar per barrel,
estimated to yield $35,000,000; a bank stamp tax

$30,000,000; a duty of three cents per pound on
coffee, and ten cents per pound on tea on hand in the

tax on tobacco, expected to yield $15,000,000.

The Congress of the United States passed a joint

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">April 22.</span></span> At half past five o’clock in the morning
the vessels composing the North Atlantic Squadron put
to sea from Key West. The flag-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> led
the way. Close behind her steamed the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> and the

At seven o’clock in the morning the first gun of the
war was fired. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span>, which had been sailing
at about six knots an hour, in obedience to orders,
suddenly swung out of line. Clouds of black smoke
poured from her long, slim stacks, her speed was gradually
increased until the water ascended in fine spray
on each side of the bow, and behind her trailed out a
long, creamy streak on the quiet waters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She was headed for a Spanish merchantman, which
was then about half a mile away, apparently paying no
heed to the monsters of war.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A shot from one of the 4-pounders was sent across
the stranger’s bow, and then, no attention having been
paid to it, a 6-inch gun was discharged. This last shot
struck the water and bounded along the surface a mile
or more, sending up great clouds of spray.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spaniard wisely concluded to heave to, and
within five minutes a boat was lowered from the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span> to put on board the first prize a crew of
six men, under command of Ensign Magruder.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The captured vessel was the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Buena Ventura</span></span>, of 1,741
tons burthen; laden with lumber, valued at eleven
thousand dollars, and carrying a deck-load of cattle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The record of this first day of hostilities was not to
end with one capture.

Late in the afternoon, almost within gunshot of the
Cuban shore, while the United States fleet was
stand<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing toward Havana, with the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Mayflower</span></span> a mile or more
in advance of the flag-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>, the merchant
steamship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Pedro</span></span> hove in sight. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Mayflower</span></span> suddenly
swung sharply to the westward, and a moment
later a string of butterfly flags went fluttering to her
masthead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> flung her answering pennant to the
breeze, and, making another signal to the fleet, which
probably meant <span class="tei tei-q">“Stay where you are until I get back,”</span>
swung her bow to the westward and went racing for
the game that the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Mayflower</span></span> had sighted. The big
cruiser dashed forward, smoke trailing in dense masses
from each of her three big funnels, a hill of foam
around her bow, and in her wake a swell like a tidal
wave. It was a winning pace, and a magnificent sight
she presented as she dashed through the choppy seas
with never an undulation of her long, graceful hull.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When she was well inshore a puff of smoke came
from the bow of the cruiser, followed by a dull report,
then another and another, until four shots had been
sent from one of the small, rapid-fire guns. The Spanish
steamer, probably believing the pursuing craft carried
no heavier guns, was trying to keep at a safe
distance until the friendly darkness of night should
hide her from view. During sixty seconds or more the
big cruiser held her course in silence, and then her
entire bow was hidden from the spectators in a swirl
of white smoke as a main battery gun roared out its
demand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whizzing shell spoke plainly to the Spanish craft,
and had hardly more than flung up a column of water
a hundred yards or less in front of the merchantman
before she was hastily rounded to with her engines
reversed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A prize crew under Ensign Marble was thrown on
board, and the steamer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Pedro</span></span>, twenty-eight hundred
tons burthen, suddenly had a change of commanders.

between the two countries, numerous questions of

will be fitted out. All treaties with the United States
are annulled; thirty days are given to American ships
to leave Spanish ports, and the rules Spain will observe
during the war are outlined in five clauses, covering
neutral flags and goods contraband of war; what will
be considered a blockade; the right of search, and what
constitutes contraband of war, ending with saying that
foreign privateers will be regarded as pirates.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">April 29.</span></span> The flag-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> was lying about
two miles off the harbour of Cabanas, having just completed
a cruise of inspection. With her were the
torpedo-boats <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Porter</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Ericsson</span></span>. On the shore
could be seen the white ruins of what may have been
the dwelling of a plantation. No signs of life were
visible. It was as if war’s alarms had never been
heard on this portion of the island.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suddenly a volley of musketry rang out, repeated
again and again, at regular intervals, and the tiny jets
of water which were sent up by the bullets told that,
concealed near about the ruins of the hacienda, a troop
of Spanish soldiers were making what possibly they
may have believed to be an attack upon the big
war-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ship. It was much as if a swarm of gnats had set
about endeavouring to worry an elephant, and likely to
have as little effect; yet Rear-Admiral Sampson believed
it was necessary to teach the enemy that any
playing at war, however harmless, was dangerous to
themselves, and he ordered that the port battery be
manned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Half a dozen shots from the 4-inch guns were considered
sufficient, although there was no evidence any
execution had been done, and the big vessel’s bow was
turned eastward just as a troop of Spanish cavalry rode
rapidly away from the ruin. The horsemen served as
a target for a 4-inch gun in the starboard battery,
and the troop dispersed in hot haste.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While this mimic warfare was being carried on off
Cabanas, a most important capture was made. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span> left the station
on the north coast, April 25th, to blockade Cienfuegos,
arriving at the latter place on the twenty-eighth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They spent the day reconnoitring, and, next morning,
in order to get better information, steamed close
to the mouth of the harbour of Cienfuegos. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span>
was to the eastward, and in the van. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>
was slightly in the rear, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span> to the
westward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All were cleared for action. Suddenly smoke was
seen rising on the western horizon, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span>,
because of her position, put on all steam in that direction.
Twenty minutes later she fired two shots across
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the bow of the coming steamer, which promptly hove to.
She was the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Argonauta</span></span>. Ensign Keunzli was sent
with a prize-crew of nine to take possession of her.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Learning that Spanish soldiers were on board, word
was given to send them to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span> immediately
as prisoners of war, and when this had been done
arrangements were made to transfer the passengers
and non-combatants to the shore. The women and
children were placed in the first boat, and under cover
of a flag of truce were soon bound toward the entrance
to Cienfuegos. A second crew took the other passengers
and landed them about noon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Argonauta</span></span> had on board Colonel Corijo of the
Third Spanish Cavalry, his first lieutenant, sergeant-major,
seven other lieutenants, and ten privates and
non-commissioned officers. The steamer also carried
a large cargo of arms and Mauser ammunition. She
was bound from Satabanao, Spain, for Cienfuegos,
stopping at Port Louis, Trinidad, and Manzanillo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Half an hour later the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span> hoisted a signal conveying
the intelligence that she had been fired upon by
Spanish boats coming out of the river. She immediately
returned the fire with the 6-pounders, and
held her ground until the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span> came up. Both
vessels then fired broadside after broadside up the
entrance to the river.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The boats coming down were two torpedo-boats and
one torpedo-boat destroyer. After twenty minutes of
firing by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span>, during the last five of which the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span> participated, the Spanish vessels ceased
firing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">April 29.</span></span> A cablegram from St. Vincent, Cape
Verde, reported the departure from that port of the
Spanish squadron, consisting of the first-class cruisers
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Almirante Oquendo</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span>,
and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span>, and the three torpedo-boat destroyers
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Furor</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Terror</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Pluton</span></span>, bound westward, probably
for Porto Rico.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">April 30.</span></span> The American schooner <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Ann Louisa
Lockwood</span></span> was taken by the Spaniards off Mole St.
Nicolas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The capture of a small Spanish schooner, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Mascota</span></span>,
near Havana, by the torpedo-boat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Foote</span></span>, closed
the record of the month of April.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anxiously awaiting some word from Manila were the
people of the United States, and it was as if everything
else was relegated to the background until information
could be had regarding that American fleet which
sailed from Mirs Bay, in the China Sea, on the afternoon
of April 27th.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">April 27.</span></span> On the twenty-seventh came information
from Hongkong that the squadron had put to sea, and
from that day until the seventh of May no word regarding
the commodore’s movements had been received,
save through Spanish sources.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then came a cablegram containing the bare facts
concerning the most complete naval victory the world
had ever known. It was the first engagement of the
war, and a crushing defeat for the enemy. It is not
strange that the people, literally overwhelmed with
joy, gave little heed to the movements of our forces
elsewhere until the details of this marvellous fight
could be sent under the oceans and across the countries,
thousands of leagues in distance, describing the
deeds of the heroes who had made their names famous
so long as history shall exist.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During such time of waiting all were eager to
familiarise themselves with the theatre of this scene
of action, and every source of information was applied
to until the bay of Manila had become as well known
as the nearest home waters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For a better understanding of the battle a rough
diagram of the bay, from the entrance as far as the
city of Manila, may not come amiss.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Twenty-six miles from the entrance to the bay is
situated the city of Manila, through which the river
Pasig runs, dividing what is known as the old city from
the new, and forming several small islands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sixteen miles from the sea is the town and arsenal
of Cavite, which, projecting as it does from the mainland,
forms a most commodious and safe harbour.
Cavite was well fortified, and directly opposite its fort,
on the mainland, was a heavy mortar battery. Between
the arsenal and the city was a Krupp battery, at what
was known as the Luneta Fort, while further toward
the sea, extending from Cavite to the outermost portion
of Limbones Point, were shore-batteries,—formidable
forts, so it had been given out by the Spanish
government, such as would render the city of Manila
impregnable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Between Limbones and Talago Point are two islands,
Corregidor and Caballo, which divide the entrance of
the bay into three channels. On each of these islands
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is a lighthouse, and it was said that both were strongly
fortified with modern guns. North of Corregidor,
nearly opposite, but on the inner shore, is the point of
San José, where was another water-battery mounting
formidable guns. That channel between Corregidor
and San José Point is known as the Boca Grande, and
is nearly two miles wide. The middle channel, or the
one situated between the two islands, is shallow, and
but little used. The third, which separates Caballo
Island from Limbones Point, is nearly three miles in
width, at least twenty fathoms deep, and known as the
Boca Chica.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All of these channels, as well as the waters of
the bay, were said to have been thickly mined, and
the enemy had caused it to be reported that no
ship could safely enter without the aid of a government
pilot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In addition to the vessels of the American fleet, as
set down at the conclusion of this chapter, were two
transports, the steamers <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nanshan</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Zafiro</span></span>, which
had come into the port of Hongkong laden with
coal shortly before Commodore Dewey’s departure, and
had been purchased by him, together with their cargoes,
in anticipation of the declaration of war.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now, the details having been set down in order
that what follows may be the better understood, we
will come to that sultry Sunday morning, shortly after
midnight, when the American fleet steamed along the
coast toward the entrance to Manila Bay, the flag-ship
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> leading, with the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Raleigh</span></span>, the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Petrel</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Concord</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Boston</span></span> following in the
order named. In the rear of these came the two
transports, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nanshan</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Zafiro</span></span>, convoyed by the
despatch steamer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">McCulloch</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The commodore had decided to enter by the Boca
Grande channel, and the fleet kept well out from
Talago Point until the great light of Corregidor came
into view.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then the crews of the war-vessels were summoned
on deck, the men ordered to wash, and afterwards
served with a cup of coffee. All lights were extinguished
except one on the stern of each ship, and that
was hooded. All hands were at quarters; all guns
loaded, with extra charges ready at hand; every eye
was strained, and every ear on the alert to catch the
slightest sound.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps there was not a man from commodore to
seaman, who believed it would be possible for the war-vessels
to enter the bay without giving an alarm, and
yet the big ships continued on and were nearly past
Corregidor Island before a gun was fired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The flag-ship was well into the bay, steaming at a
four-knot speed, when from the smoke-stack of the
little <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">McCulloch</span></span> a column of sparks shot up high
into the air. In the run her fires had fallen low,
and it became necessary to replenish them. The
firemen, perhaps fearing lest they should not be in
at the death, were more energetic than prudent, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thus a signal was given to the sleepy garrison of
Corregidor.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps they will see us now,”</span> the commodore
remarked, quietly, as his attention was called to this
indiscretion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A flash of light burst from the fort; there was a dull
report, and in the air could be heard that peculiar singing
and sighing of a flying projectile as a heavy missile
passed over the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Raleigh</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The garrison on Corregidor was awakened, but not
until after the last vessel in that ominous procession
had steamed past.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the first gun in the battle of Manila Bay, and
it neither worked harm nor caused alarm.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again and again in rapid succession came these
flashes of light, dull reports, and sinister hummings in
the air, before the American fleet gave heed that this
signal to heave to had been heard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then a 4-inch shell was sent from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Concord</span></span>
directly inside of the fortification, where it exploded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Raleigh</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Boston</span></span> each threw a shell by
way of salute, and then all was silent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The channel, which had been thickly mined, according
to the Spanish reports, was passed in safety, and
the fleet, looking so unsubstantial in the darkness, had
yet to meet the mines in the bay, as well as the Spanish
fleet, which all knew was lying somewhere near about
the city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the forward bridge of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> stood
Commo<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dore Dewey, his chief of staff, Commander Lamberton,
Lieutenant Rees, Lieutenant Calkins, and an insurgent
Filippino, who had volunteered as pilot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the conning-tower was Captain Gridley, who, much
against his will, was forced to take up his position in
that partially sheltered place because the commander
of the fleet was not willing to take the chances that
all the chief officers of the ship should be exposed to
death on the bridge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The word was given to <span class="tei tei-q">“slow down,”</span> and the speed
of the big ships decreased until they had barely
steerageway.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The men were allowed to sleep beside their
guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The moon had set, the darkness and the silence was
almost profound, until suddenly day broke, as it does in
the tropics, like unto a flash of light, and all that bay,
with its fighting-machines in readiness for the first
signal, was disclosed to view.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the masthead of the American vessels rose
tiny balls of bunting, and then were broken out,
disclosing the broad folds of the stars and stripes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cavite was hardly more than five miles ahead, and
beyond, the city of Manila.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Reina Christina</span></span>, flying the Spanish rear-admiral’s
flag, lay off the arsenal. Astern of her was
moored the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Castilla</span></span>, her port battery ready for action.
Slightly to seaward were the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Don Juan de Austria</span></span>, the

</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">Luzon</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">El Correo</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marques del Duero</span></span>, and the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">General Lezo</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They were under steam and slowly moving about,
apparently ready to receive the fire of the advancing
squadron. The flag-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Reina Christina</span></span> also was
under way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Prepare for general action! Steam at eight-knot
speed!”</span> were the signals which floated from the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> as she led the fleet in, keeping well toward
the shore opposite the city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The American fleet was yet five miles distant, when
from the arsenal came a flame and report; but the
missile was not to be seen. Another shot from Cavite,
and then was strung aloft on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> a line of tiny
flags, telling by the code what was to be the American
battle-cry: <span class="tei tei-q">“Remember the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span>,”</span> and from the throat
of every man on the incoming ships went up a shout
of defiance and exultation that the moment was near
at hand when the dastardly deed done in the harbour of
Havana might be avenged.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Steaming steadily onward were the huge vessels,
dropping astern and beyond range the transports as
they passed opposite Cavite Point, until, having gained
such a distance above the city as permitted of an evolution,
the fleet swung swiftly around until it held a
course parallel with the westernmost shore, and distant
from it mayhap six thousand yards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every nerve was strained to its utmost tension; each
man took a mental grip upon himself, believing that he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stood face to face with death; but no cheek paled; no
hand trembled save it might have been from excitement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ships were coming down on their fighting course
when a shell from one of the shore-batteries burst over
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span>; the guns from the fort and from the
water-batteries vomited jets of flame and screaming
missiles with thunderous reports; every man on the
American fleet save one believed the moment had come
when they should act their part in the battle which had
been begun by the enemy; but up went the signal:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hold your fire until close in.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Had the American fleet opened fire then, the city of
Manila would have been laid in ashes and thousands
of non-combatants slain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> was yet two miles from Cavite when,
directly in front of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span>, a huge shaft of water
shot high into the air, and with a heavy booming that
drowned the reports of the Spanish guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The torpedoes!”</span> some one on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> said,
in a low tone, with an indrawing of the breath; but
it was as if Dewey did not hear. With Farragut in
Mobile Bay he had seen the effects of such engines of
destruction, and, like Farragut, he gave little heed to
that which might in a single instant send his vessel
to the bottom, even as the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> had been sent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then, so near the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Raleigh</span></span> as to send a flood across
her decks, another spouting of water, another dull roar,
and the much vaunted mines of the Spaniards in Manila
Bay had been exploded.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The roar and crackle of the enemy’s guns still continued,
yet Dewey withheld the order which every man
was now most eager to hear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spanish gunners were getting the range; the
shells which had passed over our fleet now fell close
about them; the tension among officers and men was
terrible. They wondered how much longer the commodore
would restrain them from firing. The heat was
rapidly becoming intense. The guns’ crews began to
throw off their clothes. Soon they wore nothing but
their trousers, and perspiration fairly ran from their
bodies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still the word was not given to fire, though the ships
steadily steamed on and drew nearer the fort. Orders
were given by the officers in low voices, but they were
perfectly audible, so great was the silence which was
broken only by the throbbing of the engines. The men
hugged their posts ready to open fire at the word.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A huge shell from Cavite hissed through the air and
came directly for the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span>. High over the smoke-stack
it burst with a mighty snap. Commodore Dewey
did not raise his eyes. He simply turned, made a
motion to a boatswain’s mate who stood near the
after 5-inch gun. With a voice of thunder the man
bellowed an order along the decks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Remember the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span>!”</span> yelled a chorus of five
hundred gallant sailors. Below decks in the engine-rooms
the cry was taken up, a cry of defiance and
revenge. Up in the turrets resounded the words, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the threatening notes were swept across the bay to the
other ships.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Remember the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span>!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In that strange cry was loosed the pent-up wrath of
hundreds of American sailors who resented the cowardly
death of their comrades. It bespoke the terrible vengeance
that was about to be dealt out to the defenders
of a detestable flag.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You may fire when you are ready, Gridley,”</span> was
Commodore Dewey’s quiet remark to the captain of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span>, who was still in the conning-tower.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia’s</span></span> 8-inch gun in the forward turret
belched forth, and an instant later was run up the
signal to the ships astern:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Fire as convenient.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other vessels in the squadron followed the
example set by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span>. The big 8-inch guns
of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Boston</span></span> hurled their two hundred
and fifty pound shells at the Spanish flag-ship and
at the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Castilla</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spanish fleet fired fast and furiously. The guns
on Cavite hurled their shells at the swiftly moving
vessels; the water-batteries added their din to the
horrible confusion of noises; the air was sulphurous
with the odour of burning powder, and great clouds of
smoke hung here and there, obscuring this vessel or
that from view. It was the game of death with all its
horrible accompaniments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One big shell came toward the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> straight for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the bridge. When a hundred feet away it suddenly
burst, its fragments continuing onward. One piece
struck the rigging directly over the head of Commander
Lamberton. He did not wince.
</p>
    <a name="ill15" id="ill15" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p><div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 100%; text-align: center"><img src="images/ill15.png" alt="THE BATTLE OF MANILA BAY." title="THE BATTLE OF MANILA BAY." /><div class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-top: 0.75em"><span style="font-size: 75%">THE BATTLE OF MANILA BAY.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> continued on. It was evident Commodore
Dewey was making straight for the centre
of the enemy’s line, which was the big cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Reina
Christina</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Being the nearest ship, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> received more
attention from the Spaniards than any of the other
vessels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The water was now getting shallow. Commodore
Dewey did not wish to run aground. He altered his
course when about four thousand yards from the
Spanish vessels, and swung around to give them his
broadside.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A small torpedo-boat was seen to emerge from the
shore near the arsenal, making for the coal-laden
steamers at a high rate of speed. The secondary
batteries on the ships nearest were brought to bear
upon her; it was a veritable shower of shot and shell
which fell ahead, astern, and either side of her. To
continue on would have been certain destruction, and,
turning in the midst of that deadly hail which had
half disabled her, the craft was run high and dry
on the beach, where she was at once abandoned,
her crew doubtless fearing lest the magazines would
explode.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Open with all guns,”</span> came the signal as the course
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the American vessels was changed, and soon all the
port guns were at work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The American fleet was steaming back and forth off
Cavite Bay as if bent on leaving such a wake as would
form a figure eight, delivering broadside after broadside
with splendid results.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this time the enemy’s vessels were keeping up
a steady fire, the smaller ships retreating inside the
mole several times during the action. The forts were
not idle, but kept thundering forth their tribute with
no noticeable effect. The enemy’s fire seemed to be
concentrated on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span>, and she was hit several
times.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A 4.7-inch armour-piercing shell punctured her side
on the main-deck line, tore up the wooden deck, and,
striking the steel deck under this, glanced upward,
went through the after engine-room hatch, and, emerging,
struck the cylinder of the port 6-inch gun on the
quarter-deck, temporarily rendering the gun unfit for
use.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In its flight it also struck a box of 3-pounder
ammunition, exploding one shell, which in turn slightly
wounded one of No. 4 gun’s crew.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One shell pierced her starboard side forward of
No. 2 sponson, and lodged in a clothes-locker on the
berth-deck; another struck her port beam a little above
the water-line, and a few feet forward of, and above
this, another shell came crashing across the berth-deck,
striking a steam-pipe and exploding behind the starboard
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>blower-engine, but with no serious results. A fragment
of a shell went through one of the ventilators, and the
colours of the mainmast were shot through.
</p>

    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p><div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 100%; text-align: center"><img src="images/ill16.jpg" alt="U. S. S. BOSTON." title="U. S. S.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The concussion from the 8-inch guns on the poop
shattered the whaleboats, and they had to be cut
adrift. A fragment of a shell that burst over the
quarter-deck cut the signal halliards which Lieutenant
Brumby held in his hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Boston</span></span> a shell came through a port-hole in
Ensign Doddridge’s stateroom, and wrecked it badly.
The explosion set a fire which was quickly put out.
Another shell struck the port hammock netting, where
it burst, setting fire to the hammocks. This was also
soon extinguished. Still another shell struck the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Boston’s</span></span> foremast, cutting a great gash in it. It came
within twenty feet of Captain Wildes on the bridge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Raleigh</span></span> was forced inshore by the strong
current, and carried directly upon the bows of two
Spanish cruisers. By all the rules of warfare she
should have been sunk; but instead, her commander
delivered two raking broadsides as she steamed back
into place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three times the American ships passed back and
forth, opening first with one broadside and then with
another as the ship swung around, and then the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Reina
Christina</span></span>, black smoke pouring from her stacks, and a
vapour as of wool coming from the steam-pipes, gallantly
sallied out to meet the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Between the two flag-ships ensued a duel, in which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Spaniard was speedily worsted to such a degree
that she was literally forced to turn and make for the
shore. As she swung around, with her stern directly
toward the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span>, an 8-inch shell struck her
squarely, and the explosive must have travelled directly
through the ill-fated craft until it reached the after
boiler, where it exploded, ripping up the decks, and
vomiting forth showers of iron fragments and portions
of dismembered human bodies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A gunboat came out from behind the Cavite pier,
and made directly for the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span>. In less than five
minutes she was in a sinking condition; as she turned,
a shell struck her just inside the stern railing, and she
disappeared beneath the waves as if crushed by some
titanic force.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Navigator Calkins of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span> had soundings
taken, and told Commodore Dewey that he could take
the ship farther in toward the Spanish fleet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Take her in, then,”</span> the commodore replied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ship moved up to within two thousand yards of
the Spanish fleet. This brought the smaller guns into
effective play.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rain of shell upon the doomed Spaniards was
terrific.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Castilla</span></span> was in flames from stem to stern.
Black smoke poured up from the decks of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Isla de
Cuba</span></span>, and on the flag-ship fire was completing the work
of destruction begun by the American shells.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was 7.35 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span> when the battle, which began at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>5.41, came to a temporary close. The first round was
concluded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was yet ample time in which to finish the
work so well begun, and from the flag-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span>
went up the signal:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Cease firing and follow.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fleet was headed for the opposite shore, and, once
partially beyond range, <span class="tei tei-q">“mess-gear”</span> was sounded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only casualty worthy of mention which had
occurred was the death of Chief Engineer Frank B.
Randall, of the steamer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">McCulloch</span></span>, who died from heart
disease, probably superinduced by excitement, while the
fleet was passing Corregidor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were handshakings and congratulations on
every hand as smoke-begrimed friends, parted during
the battle, met again, and loud were the cheers that
went up from the various ships in passing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After breakfast had been served and the ships made
ready for the second round, or, in other words, at 10.15
in the forenoon, the Spanish flag-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Reina Christina</span></span>
hauled down her colours, and the admiral’s flag was
transferred to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Isla de Cuba</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At 10.45 a signal was made from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Olympia</span></span>:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Get under way with men at quarters.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again the fleet stood in toward Cavite, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span>
in the lead, but the latter vessel’s course was quickly
changed as a strange steamer was observed entering the
bay.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not many moments were spent in reconnoitring;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the signal flags soon told that the stranger was flying
the English ensign.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then came the order for the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span> to stand in
and destroy the enemy’s fortifications, and ten minutes
later the battle was on once more.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now the fire was slow and deliberate, the gunners
taking careful aim, bent on expending the least amount
of ammunition with the greatest possible execution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span> suffered most at the beginning of this
second round, because all the enemy’s fire was concentrated
upon her.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Soon after this second half of the engagement had
begun a Spanish shell exploded on the <a name="corr080a" id="corr080a" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore’s</span></span>
deck, wounding five of the crew, and another partially
disabled three. It was as if every square yard of surface
in that portion of the bay was covered by a missile
from the enemy’s guns, and yet no further damage to
the American fleet was done.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span> was within twenty-five hundred-yard
range she poured a broadside into the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Reina
Christina</span></span> which literally blew that craft into fragments,
and the smoke from the guns yet hung like a cloud
above the deck when the ill-fated flag-ship sank beneath
the waters of the bay.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <a name="corr080" id="corr080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr"><span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Don Juan de Austria</span></span></span> was the next of the enemy’s

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">General Lezo</span></span> was run on shore and abandoned
to the flames.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Castilla</span></span> was scuttled by her crew lest
the fire which was raging fiercely should explode her

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 2.</span></span> In Manila Bay, on Monday, the second
of May, there was much to be done in order to
complete the work so thoroughly begun the day
previous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Early in the morning an officer came from Corregidor,
under flag of truce, to Commodore Dewey, with a
proposal of surrender from the commandant of the fortifications.
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span> was sent to attend to the
business; but when she arrived at the island no one
save the commanding officer was found. All his men
had deserted him after overthrowing the guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Baltimore</span></span> had but just steamed away, when
Commander Lamberton was ordered to go on board the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Petrel</span></span> and run over to Cavite arsenal in order that he
might take possession, for on the previous day a white
flag had been hoisted there as a signal of surrender.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the surprise of Lamberton he found, on landing,
that the troops were under arms, and Captain Sostoa,
of the Spanish navy, was in anything rather than a surrendering
mood. On being asked as to the meaning
of affairs, Sostoa replied that the flag had been hoisted
for a truce, not as a token of capitulation. He was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg 93]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>given until noon to decide as to his course of action,
and the Americans withdrew. At 10.45 the white
flag was again hoisted, and when Lamberton went on
shore once more he found that the Spaniard had
marched his men away, taking with them all their
arms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was the moment when the insurgents, who had
gathered near the town, believed their opportunity
had come, and, rushing into Cavite, they began an
indiscriminate plunder which was not brought to
an end until the American marines were landed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The navy yard was seized; six batteries near about
the entrance of Manila Bay were destroyed; the cable
from Manila to Hongkong was cut, and Commodore
Dewey began a blockade of the port.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Congress appropriated $35,720,945 for the emergency
war appropriation bill.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eleven regiments of infantry, one of cavalry, and ten
light batteries of artillery were concentrated at Tampa
and Port Tampa. General Shafter assumed command
on this date.

By cablegram from London, under date of May 2d,
news regarding the condition of affairs in Madrid was
received. The Spanish public was greatly excited by
information from the Philippines, and the authorities
found it necessary to proclaim martial law, the document
being couched in warlike language beginning:
</p>

Commenting upon the defeat, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">El Nacional</span></span>, of
Madrid, published the following article:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Yesterday, when the first intelligence arrived,
nothing better occurred to Admiral Bermejo (Minister
of Marine) than to send to all newspapers comparative
statistics of the contending squadrons. By this comparison
he sought to direct public attention to the immense
superiority over a squadron of wooden vessels
dried up by the heat in those latitudes.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“But in this document Spain can see nothing kind.
Spain undoubtedly sees therein the heroism of our
marines; but she sees also and above all the nefarious
crime of the government.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is unfair to blame the enemy for possessing
forces superior to ours; but what is worthy of being
blamed with all possible vehemence is this infamous
government, which allowed our inferiority without
neutralising it by means of preparations. This is
the truth. Our sailors have been basely delivered
over to the grape-shot of the Yankees, a fate nobler
and more worthy of respect than those baneful ministers,
who brought about the first victory and its victims.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">El Heraldo de Madrid</span></span> said: <span class="tei tei-q">“It was no caprice of
the fortunes of war. From the very first cannon-shot
our fragile ships were at the mercy of the formidable
hostile squadron. They were condemned to fall one
after another under the fire of the American batteries,
powerless to strike, and were defended only by the
valour in the breasts of their sailors.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What has been gained by the illusion that Manila
was fortified? What has been gained by the intimation
that the broad and beautiful bay on whose bosom
the Spanish fleet perished yesterday had been rendered
inaccessible? What use was made of the famous
island of Corregidor? What was done with its guns?
Where were the torpedoes? Where were those defensive
preparations concerning which we were requested
to keep silence?”</span>

The government tug <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Leyden</span></span> left Key West, towing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a Cuban expedition under government auspices to
establish communication with the Cuban forces in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the same day the Norwegian steamer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Condor</span></span>
arrived with twelve American refugees and their immediate
relatives from Cienfuegos, Cuba.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr. Herman Mazarredo, a dentist, who had been
practising his profession in Cienfuegos for eight
months, after six years’ study in the United States,
was one of the passengers. He gave the following
account of himself:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Because the Spaniards hated me as intensely as if
I had been born in America, I was obliged to flee for
my life. I left my mother, six sisters, and five brothers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in Cienfuegos. I consider that their lives are in danger.
May heaven protect them! What was I to do?</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“There are now about two hundred Americans at
Cienfuegos clamouring to get away. They are sending
to Boston and New York for steamers, but without
avail. Owen McGarr, the American consul, told me
on his departure that the Spanish law would protect
me. Other Americans would have come on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Condor</span></span>,
but Captain Miller would not take them. There was
not room for them. The Spanish soldiers have not yet
become personally insulting on the streets, but a mob
of Spanish residents marched through the city four
days before the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Condor</span></span> left, shouting, <span class="tei tei-q">‘We want to kill
all Americans.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There are between four thousand and six thousand
Spanish troops concentrating at Cienfuegos under command
of Major-General Aguirre. They have thrown up
some very poor breastworks. Three ground-batteries
look toward the open sea.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bread riots broke out in Spain. In Gijon, on the
Bay of Biscay, the rioters made a stand and were fired
upon by the troops. Fourteen were killed or wounded,
yet the infuriated populace held their ground, nor were
they driven back until the artillery was ordered out.
Then a portion of the soldiers joined the mob; a cannon
with ammunition was seized, and directed against
the fortification. A state of siege was declared, and
an order issued that all the bread be baked in the government
bakeries, because the mob had looted the shops.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At Talavera de la Reina, thirty-six miles from Toledo,
a mob attacked the railroad station, entirely destroying
it, setting fire to the cars, and starting the engines wild
upon the track. They burned several houses owned
by officials, and sacked a monastery, forcing the priests
to flee for their lives. Procuring wine from the inns,
they grew more bold, and made an attack upon the
prison, hoping to release those confined there; but at
this point they were held in check by the guard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The miners of Oviedo inaugurated a strike, commencing
by inciting riots. At Caceres several people
were killed. At Malaga a mob rode down the guards
and looted the shops. The British steam yacht <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Lady
of Clonmel</span></span>, owned by Mr. James Wilkinson, of London,
was attacked as she lay at the pier. Stones smashed
her skylights, and a bomb was thrown aboard, but did
not explode. The yacht put hurriedly to sea, and from
Gibraltar reported the outrage to London.

of her voyage:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She proceeded to a certain point near Mariel, and
landed five men, with four boxes of ammunition and
two horses.

The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Leyden</span></span> lay to outside the harbour until five

She proceeded to Matanzas, and on the afternoon of
the third landed another small party near there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fearing attack by the Spaniards, she looked for the
monitors <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Terror</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitrite</span></span>, which were on the

them the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Leyden</span></span> returned to the original landing-place,
reaching there early on the morning of the
fourth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There she was met by Acosta and about two hundred
Cubans, half of whom were armed with rifles.
They united with the men on the tug, and an
attempt was made to land the remaining arms and
men, when two hundred of the Villa Viscosa cavalry
swooped down on them, and an engagement of a half
hour’s duration followed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Cubans finally repulsed the enemy, driving
them into the woods. The Spanish carried with
them many wounded and left sixteen dead on the
field.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the engagement the bullets went through
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Leyden’s</span></span> smoke-stack, but no one was injured.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The little tug then went in search of the flag-ship,
found her lying near Havana, and reported the
facts.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rear-Admiral Sampson sent the gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on the afternoon of the fourth, and found the Spanish

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> promptly opened fire on a number

no protest was made by the representatives of the

the French legation in Washington was instructed

at New York to the credit of the treasurer of

to you at Washington. I, therefore, enclose my check
for the above amount, drawn payable to your order

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 6.</span></span> The torpedo-boats <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Dupont</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hornet</span></span>
shelled the blockhouse near the lighthouse at Point
Maya, at the mouth of the harbour of Matanzas,
and Fort Garcia, which is an old hacienda used as
a blockhouse, lying three and one-half miles to the
east.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Dupont</span></span> was leaving her position off the
lighthouse point, a big shell was fired from the middle
embrasure of a battery on the other side of the harbour,
called Gorda. The line was perfect, but the elevation
was bad, and the range too long. The shell fell a
thousand yards short. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hornet</span></span> was ordered to use
her 6-pounders on the blockhouse. The first shell
failed of its purpose; but the second hit the target
fairly, and the Spanish soldiers hurriedly left it for
shelter among the neighbouring trees.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hornet</span></span> fired twelve shells, six of which struck
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the mark. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Dupont</span></span>, after ascertaining that Point
Maya was being made too warm for Spanish occupation,
steamed down to a blockhouse opposite, called
Garcia Red, and a prominent landmark to the eastward,
and turned loose her 1-pounders.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here, as in the other place, the infantry had urgent
business behind the forest woods and hills. After
making certain they had gone to stay, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Dupont</span></span>
resumed patrol duty. Cavalry afterward appeared at
Fortina, but remained there only long enough to see
the torpedo-boat’s menacing attitude.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 6.</span></span> The cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Montgomery</span></span>, Captain Converse,
was the first ship of the American squadron to acquire
the distinction of capturing two prizes in one day, which
she did on the sixth. The captives were the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Frasquito</span></span>
and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Lorenzo</span></span>, both small vessels of no great value as
compared with the big steamers taken during the first
days of the war.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Montgomery</span></span> was cruising about fifty miles off
Havana when the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Frasquito</span></span>, a two-master, came bowling
along toward the Cuban capital. When the yellow
flag of the enemy was sighted the helm was swung in
her direction, and a blank shot was put across her
bow. The Spaniard hove to and the customary
prize-crew was put on board. It was found that the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Frasquito</span></span> was bound from Montevideo to Havana
with a cargo of jerked beef. She was of about 140
tons register and hailed from Barcelona. The prize-crew
took her to Havana waters, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Annapolis</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>assigned the cutter <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamilton</span></span> to carry her into Key
West.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few minutes afterwards the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Montgomery</span></span> encountered
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Lorenzo</span></span>, a Spanish bark, bound from Barcelona
to Havana with a cargo of dried beef. She was
taken just as easily, and Ensign Osborn, with several
<span class="tei tei-q">“Jackies,”</span> sailed her into port.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 7.</span></span> Quite a sharp little affair occurred off
Havana, in which the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span> and the cutter <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill</span></span>
were very nearly enticed to destruction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A small schooner was sent out from Havana harbour
shortly before daylight to draw some of the Americans
into an ambuscade.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She ran off to the eastward, hugging the shore with
the wind on her starboard quarter. About three miles
east of the entrance of the harbour she came over on
the port tack.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A light haze fringed the horizon, and she was not
discovered until three miles off shore, when the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Mayflower</span></span>
made her out and signalled the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill</span></span>. Captain Smith of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span> immediately
clapped on all steam and started in pursuit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The schooner instantly put about and ran for Morro
Castle before the wind. On doing so, she would,
according to the plot, lead the two American war-ships
directly under the guns of the Santa Clara
batteries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These works are a short mile west of Morro, and are
a part of the defences of the harbour. There were two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>batteries, one at the shore, which had been recently
thrown up, of sand and mortar, with wide embrasures
for 8-inch guns, and the other on the crest of the
rocky eminence which juts out into the waters of
the gulf at the point. The upper battery mounted
modern 10 and 12-inch Krupp guns, behind a six-foot
stone parapet, in front of which were twenty feet
of earthwork and belting of railroad iron.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The American vessels were about six miles from the
schooner when the chase began. They steamed after
her at full speed, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill</span></span> leading, until within a
mile and a half of the Santa Clara batteries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Commander Smith of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span> was the first to
realise the danger into which the reckless pursuit had
led them. He concluded it was time to haul off, and
sent a shot across the bow of the schooner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spanish skipper instantly brought his vessel
about, but while she was still rolling in the trough of
the sea with her sails flapping, an 8-inch shrapnel
shell came hurtling through the air from the water-battery,
a mile and a half away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It passed over the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill</span></span>, between the pilot-house
and the smoke-stack, and exploded less than fifty feet
away on the port quarter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two more shots followed in quick succession, both
shrapnel. One burst close under the starboard quarter,
filling the engine-room with the smoke of the exploding
shell, and the other, like the first, passed over and
exploded just beyond.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spanish gunners had the range, and their time
fuses were accurately set.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The crews of both ships were at their guns. Lieutenant
Craig, who was in charge of the bow 4-inch
rapid-fire gun of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill</span></span>, asked for and obtained
permission to return the fire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the first shot the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span>, which was in the
wake of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill</span></span>, slightly inshore, sheered off and
passed to windward under the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill’s</span></span> stern. In the
meantime Captain Smith also put his helm to port, and
was none too soon, for as the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill</span></span> stood off a solid
8-inch shot grazed her starboard quarter and kicked
up tons of water as it struck a wave one hundred yards
beyond.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All the guns of the water-battery were now at work.
One of them cut the Jacob’s-ladder of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span>
adrift, and another carried away a portion of the rigging.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the vessels steamed away their aft guns were
used, but only a few shots were fired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill’s</span></span> 6-inch gun was elevated for four
thousand yards, and struck the earthwork repeatedly.
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span> discharged only three shots from her
6-pounder.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spaniards continued to fire shot and shell for
twenty minutes, but none of the latter shots came
within one hundred yards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Later in the day the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill</span></span> captured the Spanish
schooner <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Espana</span></span>, bound for Havana, and towed the
prize to Key West.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 7.</span></span> The United States despatch-boat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">McCulloch</span></span>
arrived at Hongkong from Manila, with details of
Commodore Dewey’s victory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secretary Long, after the cablegram forwarded from
Hongkong had been received, sent the following
despatch:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The President, in the name of the American people,
thanks you and your officers and men for your splendid
achievement and overwhelming victory. In recognition
he has appointed you acting admiral, and will recommend
a vote of thanks to you by Congress as a
foundation for further promotion.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 8.</span></span> A brilliant, although unimportant, affair was
that in which the torpedo-boat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> engaged off
Cardenas Bay.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> and gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Machias</span></span> were on the
blockade off Cardenas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the harbour, defended by thickly strewn mines
and torpedoes, three small gunboats had been bottled
up since the beginning of the war. Occasionally they
stole out toward the sea, but never venturing beyond
the inner harbour, running like rabbits at sight of the
American torpedo boats.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally a buoy was moored by Spaniards inside the
entrance of the bay to mark the position for the
entrance of the gunboats. The signal-station on
the shore opposite was instructed to notify the
gun<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>boats inside when the torpedo-boats were within the
limit distance marked by the buoy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The scheme was that the gunboats could run out,
open fire at a one-mile range thus marked off for them,
and retreat without the chance of being cut off. The
men of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> eyed this buoy and guessed its
purpose, but did not attempt to remove it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the afternoon of the eighth the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Machias</span></span> stood
away to the eastward for a jaunt, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> was
left alone to maintain the blockade.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a short time she steamed toward Cardenas
Harbour. There was great excitement at the signal-station,
and flags fluttered hysterically. The three
gunboats slipped their cables and went bravely out to
their safety limit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three bow 6-pounders were trained at two thousand
yards. In a few minutes the shore signals told them
that the torpedo-boat was just in range. Every Spaniard
aboard prepared to see the Americans blown out of
the water.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three 6-pounders crackled, and three shells threw
waterspouts around the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>, but she was not
struck. Instead of running away, she upset calculations
by driving straight ahead, attacking the boats,
and Lieutenant Bernado no sooner saw the first white
smoke puffs from the Spanish guns than he gave the
word to the men already stationed at the two forward
1-pounders, which barked viciously and dropped shot
in the middle of the flotilla.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On plunged the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> to within fifteen hundred
yards of the gunboats, while the row raised by the
rapid-fire 1-pounders was like a rattling tattoo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spaniards were apparently staggered at this
fierce onslaught, single-handed, and fired wildly. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> swung around broadside to, to bring her two
after guns to bear as the Spanish boats scattered and
lost formation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> soon manœuvred so that she was
peppering at all three gunboats at once. The sea was
very heavy, and the knife-like torpedo-boat rolled so
wildly that it was impossible to do good gun practice,
but despite this big handicap, the rapidity of her fire
and the remarkable effectiveness of her guns demoralised
all three opponents, which, after the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> had
fired about fifty shells, began to gradually work back
toward the shelter of the harbour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They were still hammering away with their 6-pounders,
but were wild. Several shells passed over
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>. One exploded a hundred feet astern,
but the others fell short.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At last a 1-pounder from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> went fair
and true, and struck the hull of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Lopez</span></span> a little aft of
amidships, apparently exploding on the inside.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> men yelled. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Lopez</span></span> stopped, evidently
disabled, while one of her comrades went to her
assistance. By this time the Spanish boats had retreated
nearly inside, where they could not be followed
because of the mines. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Lopez</span></span> got under way
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>slowly and limped homeward with the help of a towline
from her consort.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During this episode the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Machias</span></span> had returned, and
when within a two-mile range let fly two 4-inch
shells from her starboard battery, which accelerated the
Spanish flight. But the flotilla managed to creep back
into Cardenas Harbour in safety, and under the guns of
the shore-battery.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spanish gunboats that lured the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> into
the death-trap were the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Antonio Lopez</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Lealtad</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Ligera</span></span>. During the fight the two former retreated
behind the wharves, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Ligera</span></span> behind the key. It
was the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Antonio Lopez</span></span> that opened fire on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>
and decoyed her into the channel. The Spanish troops
formed on the public square, not daring to go to the
wharves. All the Spanish flags were lowered, as they
furnished targets, and the women and children fled to
Jovellanos.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 11.</span></span> Running from Cienfuegos, Cuba, at daybreak
on the morning of May 11th, were three telegraph
cables. The fleet in the neighbourhood consisted
of the cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>, which had been on the
station three weeks, the gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span>, which had
been there two weeks, and the converted revenue cutter
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Windom</span></span>, which had arrived two days before. The station
had been a quiet one, except for a few brushes
with some Spanish gunboats, which occasionally ventured
a very little way out of Cienfuegos Harbour.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>They had last appeared on the tenth, but had retreated,
as usual, when fired on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Commander McCalla of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>, ranking
officer, instructed Lieutenant Anderson to call for
volunteers to cut the cable early on the morning of the
eleventh. Anderson issued the call on both the cruiser
and the gunboat, and three times the desired number of
men offered to serve. No one relented, even after
repeated warnings that the service was especially
dangerous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I want you men to understand,”</span> Anderson said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that you are not ordered to do this work, and are not
obliged to.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The men nearly tumbled over one another in their
eagerness to be selected. In the end, the officer had
simply the choice of the entire crew of the two ships.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A cutter containing twelve men, and a steam launch
containing six, were manned from each ship, and a
guard of marines and men to man the 1-pounder
guns of the launches, were put on board. In the
meantime the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span> had taken a position one
thousand yards offshore opposite the Colorado Point
lighthouse, which is on the east side of the narrow
entrance to Cienfuegos Harbour, just east of the cable
landing, and, with the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span> a little farther to the
west, had begun shelling the beach.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The shore there is low, and covered with a dense
growth of high grass and reeds. The lighthouse stood
on an elevation, behind which, as well as hidden in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>long grass, were known to be a large number of rifle-pits,
some masked machine guns, and 1-pounders.
These the Spaniards deserted as fast as the ships’ fire
reached them. As the enemy’s fire slackened and died
out, the boats were ordered inshore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They advanced in double column. The launches,
under Lieutenant Anderson and Ensign McGruder of
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span>, went ahead with their sharpshooters and
gunners, looking eagerly for targets, while the cutters
were behind with the grappling-irons out, and the
men peering into the green water for a sight of the
cables. At a distance of two hundred feet from
shore the launches stopped, and the cutters were sent
ahead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first cable was picked up about ninety feet offshore.
No sooner had the work of cutting it been
begun than the Spanish fire recommenced, the soldiers
skulking back to their deserted rifle-pits and rapid-fire
guns through the high grass. The launches replied
and the fire from the ships quickened, but although the
Spanish volleys slackened momentarily, every now and
then they grew stronger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The men in the boats cut a long piece out of the first
cable, stowed it away for safety, and then grappled for
the next. Meantime the Spaniards were firing low in
an evident endeavour to sink the cutters, but many of
their shots fell short. The second cable was finally
found, and the men with the pipe-cutters went to work
on it.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Several sailors were kept at the oars to hold the
cutters in position, and the first man wounded was one
of these. No one else in the boat knew it, however,
till he fainted in his seat from loss of blood. Others
took the cue from this, and there was not a groan or a
complaint from the two boats, as the bullets, that were
coming thicker and faster every minute, began to bite
flesh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The men simply possessed themselves with heroic
patience, and went on with the work. They did not
even have the satisfaction of returning the Spanish fire,
but the marines in the stern of the boat shot hard
enough for all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second cable was finally cut, and the third, a
smaller one, was grappled and hoisted to the surface.
The fire of the Spanish had reached its maximum. It
was estimated that one thousand rifles and guns were
speaking, and the men who handled them grew incautious,
and exposed themselves in groups here and
there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Use shrapnel,”</span> came the signal, and can after can
exploded over the Spaniards, causing them to break
and run to cover.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This cover was a sort of fortification behind the
lighthouse, and to this place they dragged a number of
their machine guns, and again opened fire on the
cutter. The shots from behind the lighthouse could
not be answered so well from the launches, and the
encouraged Spaniards fired all the oftener.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Man after man in the boats was hit, but none let a
sound escape him. Like silent machines they worked,
grimly hacking and tearing at the third cable. During
half an hour they laboured, but the fire from behind
the lighthouse was too deadly, and, reluctantly, at Lieutenant
Anderson’s signal, the cable was dropped and
the boats retreated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The work had lasted two hours and a half.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Windom</span></span>, which had laid out of range with a
collier, was now ordered in, and the surgeon called to
attend the wounded. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Windom</span></span> was signalled to
shell the lighthouse, which had not been fired on
before, according to the usages of international law.
It had been used as a shelter by the Spaniards. The
revenue cutter’s rapid-fire guns riddled the structure
in short order, and soon a shell from the 4-inch gun,
which was in charge of Lieut. R. O. Crisp, struck it
fair, exploded, and toppled it over.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the collapse of their protection the Spaniards
broke and ran again, the screaming shrapnel bursting
all around them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the fall of the lighthouse the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span> signalled,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well done,”</span> and then a moment later, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cease
firing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only man killed instantly was a marine named
Eagan. A sailor from one of the boats died of his
wounds on the same day. Commander Maynard of
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nashville</span></span> was grazed across the chest, and Lieutenant
Winslow was wounded in the hand.

The list of casualties resulting from this display of
heroism was two killed, two fatally and four badly

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 11.</span></span> The Spanish batteries in Cardenas Harbour
were silenced on May 11th, and at the
same time there was a display of heroism, on the part
of American sailors, such as has never been surpassed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A plan of action having been decided upon, the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> arrived at the blockading station from Key
West on the morning of the eleventh. She found there,
off Piedras Bay, the cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Machias</span></span>, the torpedo-boat
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>, and the revenue cutter <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hudson</span></span>, which last
carried two 6-pounders. Shortly after noon the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hudson</span></span> moved into the inner
harbour of Cardenas, and prepared to draw the fire of
the Spanish batteries on the water-front. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span>
took a range of about twenty-five hundred
yards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Cardenas land defences consisted of a battery
in a stone fortification on the mole or quay, a battery
of field-pieces, and of infantry armed with long-range
rifles. The gunboats were equipped with rapid-fire
guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Firing commenced at one o’clock, and when the
Cardenas batteries were silenced at two in the afternoon,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> had sent 376 shells into them and the
town. Her 4-inch guns had been fired 144 times.
She had aimed 122 shots from her 6-pounders, and
110 from her 1-pounders, over six shots a minute.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> ceased firing she had moved
up to within one thousand yards range of the Spanish
guns, and there were only six inches of water under her
keel. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> draws nine feet of water forward
and ten and a half feet aft. When the soundings
showed that she was almost touching, her guns
were in full play, and the Spaniards had missed a
beautiful opportunity. The Spanish gunners must
have miscalculated her distance and misjudged her
draught, else they would have done more effective
work at a range of two thousand yards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the engagement, when the commander of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span> found that he could not approach close enough
to the Spanish gunboats to use his torpedo-tubes to
any advantage, he remained under fire. At that time
he could have got out of harm’s way by taking shelter
to the leeward of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Captain Todd, from his post of duty in the conning-tower
of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span>, saw a Spanish shell, aimed for
the torpedo-boat, do its deadly work. The shell struck
the water, took an up-shoot, and exploded on the deck
of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>. There is little room for men anywhere
on a torpedo boat, and if a shot strikes at all it
is almost sure to hit a group. Such was the case in
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>. The exploding shell cost the lives of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Ensign Bagley and four seamen; it also crippled the
craft by wrecking her steam-steering gear. Later her
captain and one of his crew were wounded by separate
shots.

and the other two died while being removed to the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The signal, <span class="tei tei-q">“Many wounded,”</span> went up from the staff
of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>, and Passed Assistant Surgeon Cook of
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> boarded the torpedo-boat.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

men were tenderly cared for on the cruiser, and that
night the revenue cutter steamed out of Cardenas Bay,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
William O’Hearn, of Brooklyn, N. Y., one of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow’s</span></span> crew, thus tells his story of the battle to a
newspaper correspondent:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“From the very beginning,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I think every
man on the boat believed that we could not escape
being sunk, and that is what would have happened
had it not been for the bravery of the boys on the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hudson</span></span>, who worked for over an hour under the most
terrific fire to get us out of range.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Were you ordered to go in there?”</span> he was asked.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; just before we were fired upon the order was
given from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Was it a signal order?”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No; we were near enough to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> so
that they shouted it to us from the deck, through the
megaphone.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you remember the words of the commander
who gave them?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t know who shouted the order; but the
words as I remember them were, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Mr. Bagley, go in
and see what gunboats there are.’</span> We started at once
towards the Cardenas dock, and the firing began soon
after.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The first thing I saw,”</span> continued O’Hearn, <span class="tei tei-q">“was a
shot fired from a window or door in the second story of
the storehouse just back of the dock where the Spanish
gunboats were lying. A shell then went hissing
over our heads. Then the firing began from the gunboat
at the wharf, and from the shore. The effect of
shell and heavy shot the first time a man is under fire
is something terrible.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“First you hear that awful buzzing or whizzing, and
then something seems to strike you in the face and
head. I noticed that at first the boys threw their hands
to their heads every time a shell went over; but they
soon came so fast and so close that it was a roaring,
shrieking, crashing hell.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I am the water-tender, and my place is below, but
everybody went on deck when the battle began. John
Varvares, the oiler, John Denif and John Meek, the
firemen, were on watch with me, and had they remained
below they would not have been killed.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“After the firing began I went below again to attend
to the boiler, and a few minutes later a solid shot
came crashing through the side of the boat and into
the boiler, where it exploded and destroyed seventy
of the tubes.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“At first it stunned me. When the shell burst in
the boiler it threw both the furnace doors open, and
the fuse from the shell struck my feet. It was a terrible
crash, and the boiler-room was filled with dust
and steam. For several seconds I was partially stunned,
and my ears rang so I could hear nothing. I went up
on the deck to report to Captain Bernadou.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I saw him near the forecastle gun, limping about
with a towel wound around his left leg. He was
shouting, and the noise of all the guns was like continuous
thunder. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Captain,’</span> I cried, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the forward
boiler is disabled. A shell has gone through it.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Get out the hose,’</span> he said, and turned to the gun
again. I made my way to the boiler-room, in a few
minutes went up on the deck again, and the fighting
had grown hotter than ever. Several of the men were
missing, and I looked around.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Lying all in a heap on the after-deck in the
starboard quarter, near the after conning-tower, I saw
five of our men where they had wilted down after the
shell struck them. In other places were men lying
groaning, or dragging themselves about, wounded and
covered with blood. There were big red spots on the
deck, which was strewn with fragments and splinters.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“I went to where the five men were lying, and saw
that all were not dead. John Meek could speak and
move one hand slightly. I put my face down close to
his.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

supposed he was dead, and covered him up the same

him calling, and saw that he was making a slight
movement under the clothes. I went up to him, and
he said:</span>

The young officer, realising that the wound was

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 12.</span></span> The forts of San Juan, the capital of
Porto Rico, were bombarded by a portion of Rear-Admiral
Sampson’s fleet on Thursday morning, May
12th. The vessels taking part in the action were the
battle-ships <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span>, the cruisers

<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitrite</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The engagement began at 5.15 and ended at 8.15
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span>, resulting in a loss to the Americans of one
killed and seven wounded, and the death of one from
prostration by heat. The Spanish loss, as reported
by cable to Madrid, was five killed and forty-three
wounded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Admiral Sampson’s orders were to refrain from
making any land attack so long as the batteries on
shore did not attempt to molest his ships; but in case
the Spaniards fired on his vessels, to destroy the
offending fortifications.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These orders were not issued until the Spanish fire
at different Cuban ports became so irritating to the
American bluejackets that discipline was, in a measure,
threatened; but as soon as the men learned that they
were no longer to remain passive targets for the
Spaniards, but were to return any shots against them,
all grumbling against inaction ceased.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was not Admiral Sampson’s original intention to
attack San Juan. He was looking for bigger game
than the poorly defended Porto Rican capital. His
orders from the Navy Department were to find and
capture or destroy the Spanish squadron that was en
route from the Cape Verde Islands, and it was this
business that took him into the neighbourhood of San
Juan, he being desirous of learning if the Spanish
squadron were there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fleet arrived off San Juan before daybreak on
Thursday. The tug <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wampatuck</span></span> was ordered to take
soundings in the channel, and at once proceeded to do
so. She was fully half a mile ahead of the fleet when
she entered the channel, and those aboard of her kept
the lead going at a lively rate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is supposed that Admiral Sampson had no intention
at that time of entering the harbour itself, his
object, when he found that the Spanish squadron was
not at San Juan, being to learn for future use exactly
how much water there was in the channel, and if any
attempt had been made to block the way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At all events, while the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wampatuck</span></span> was engaged in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>this work she was seen by the sentries at the Morro,
and a few minutes later was fired on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then, and not until then, did Admiral Sampson
determine to teach the Spaniards a lesson regarding
the danger of firing on the American flag.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Quarters!”</span> rang out aboard the war-ships almost
before the report of the Morro gun had died away, the
flag-ship having signalled for action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> opened the bombardment with her big
12-inch gun, the missile striking Morro Castle squarely,
and knocking a great hole in the masonry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span> sent a 13-inch projectile from
the forward turret, and one after the other, with but
little loss of time, the remaining vessels of the fleet
aided in the work of destruction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The French war-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Admiral Rigault de Genoailly</span></span>
was at anchor in the harbour, and a shell exploded
within a few hundred feet of where she lay, but worked
no injury.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The French officers thus reported the action:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The American gunners were generally accurate in
their firing, while the marksmanship of the Spaniards
was inferior. Some of the American shells, however,
passed over the fortifications into the city, where they
did terrible damage, crashing straight through rows of
buildings before exploding, and there killing many
citizens.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The fortifications were irreparably injured. Repeatedly
masses of masonry were blown skyward by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the shells from the American guns. Fragments from
one shell struck the commandante’s residence, which
was situated near the fortifications, damaging it
terrifically.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Morro Castle was speedily silenced, and then the
guns of the fleet were turned on the land-batteries
and the fortifications near the government buildings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inhabitants fled in terror from the city; the
volunteers, panic-stricken, ran frantically in every
direction, discharging their weapons at random, until
they were a menace to all within possible range. The
crashing of the falling buildings, the roar of the heavy
guns, the shrieks of the terrified and groans of the
wounded, formed a horrible accompaniment to the work
of destruction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three times the line of American ships passed from
the entrance of the harbour to the extreme eastward
battery, sending shot and shell into the crumbling
forts. Clouds of dust showed where the missiles
struck, but the smoke hung over everything. The
shells screeching overhead and dropping around were
the only signs that the Spaniards still stuck to their
guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At 7.45 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span> Admiral Sampson signalled, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cease
firing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Retire”</span> was sounded on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>, and she headed
from the shore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Terror</span></span> was the last ship in the line, and, failing
to see the signal, banged away alone for about half an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hour, the concert of shore guns roaring at her and the
water flying high around her from the exploding shells.
But she possessed a charmed life, and reluctantly
retired at 8.15.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 13.</span></span> In the Spanish Cortes, Señor Molinas,
deputy for Porto Rico, protested against the bombardment
of San Juan without notice, as an infringement of
international usage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this General Correa, Minister of War, replied that
the conduct of the Americans was <span class="tei tei-q">“vandalism,”</span> and
that the government <span class="tei tei-q">“will bring their outrageous
action under the notice of the powers.”</span> He echoed
Señor Molinas’s eulogy of the bravery of the Spanish
troops and marines, and promised that the government
would send its thanks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An authority on international law thus comments
upon the bombardment, in the columns of the New
York <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sun</span></span>:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“There is nothing in the laws of war which requires
notice of bombardment to be given to a fortified place,
during the progress of war. When the Germans
threatened to bombard Port au Prince, a few months
ago, they gave a notice of a few hours, but in that case
no state of war existed. Again, when Spain bombarded
Valparaiso, in 1865, an hour’s interval was allowed between
the blank charge that gave the notice, and
the actual bombardment. But that interval was
intended to allow Chili an opportunity to do the
specific thing demanded, namely, to salute the Spanish
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>flag, in atonement for a grievance. Besides, Valparaiso
was wholly unfortified, and the guns were directed,
not at military works, but at public buildings.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The case of San Juan was far different. Hostilities
had been going on in Gulf waters for weeks, while, as
Doctor Snow, the well-known authority on international
law, says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘In case of war, the very fact of a place being
fortified is evidence that at any time it is liable to attack,
and the non-combatants residing within its limits
must be prepared for a contingency of this kind.’</span> This
is true, also, of the investment of fortified places by
armies, where <span class="tei tei-q">‘if the assault is made, no notice is given,
as surprise is essential to success.’</span> In the same spirit
Halleck says that <span class="tei tei-q">‘every besieged place is for a time a
military garrison; its inhabitants are converted into
soldiers by the necessities of self-defence.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Turning to the official report of Admiral Sampson,
we find him saying that, as soon as it was light enough,
he began <span class="tei tei-q">‘an attack upon the batteries defending the
city. This attack lasted about three hours, and resulted
in much damage to the batteries, and incidentally to a
portion of the city adjacent to the batteries.’</span> It is,
therefore, clear that this latter damage was simply the
result of the proximity of the defensive works to some
of the dwellings. The same thing would occur in bombarding
Havana. Can any one imagine that the Spaniards,
if they suddenly appeared in New York Bay,
would be obliged to give notice before opening fire on
Fort Hamilton and Fort Wadsworth, for the reason that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>adjacent settlements would suffer from the fire? The
advantage of suddenness in the attack upon a place, not
only fortified, but forewarned by current events, cannot
be renounced. Civilians dwelling near defensive works
know what they risk in war.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the Franco-German war of 1870 there were
repeated instances, according to the authority already
quoted, of deliberately firing on inhabited towns instead
of on their fortifications, and <span class="tei tei-q">‘there were cases, like
that of Peronne, where the town was partially destroyed
while the ramparts were nearly intact.’</span> The ground
taken was that which a military writer, General Le
Blois, had advocated five years before, namely, that the
pressure for surrender exercised by the people becomes
greater on subjecting them to the loss of life and property.
<span class="tei tei-q">‘The governor is made responsible for all the
disasters that occur; the people rise against him, and
his own troops seek to compel him to an immediate
capitulation.’</span> At San Juan there was no attempt of
this sort, the fire being concentrated upon the batteries,
with the single view of destroying them. The likelihood
that adjacent buildings and streets would suffer did not
require previous notice of the bombardment, and, in
fact, when the Germans opened fire on Paris without
notification, and a protest was made on behalf of neutrals,
Bismarck simply replied that no such notification
was required by the laws of war.”</span>

gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> stood in close to the coast, off
the town of Cardenas, with her crew at quarters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She had come for a specific purpose, which was to
avenge the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>, and not until she was within
range of the gunboats that had decoyed the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>
did she slacken speed. Then the masked battery, which
had opened on the American boat with such deadly
effect, was covered by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington’s</span></span> guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were no preliminaries. The war-vessel was
there to teach the Spaniards of Cardenas a lesson, and
set about the task without delay.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The town is three miles distant from the gulf
entrance to the harbour, therefore no time need be
wasted in warning non-combatants, for they were in
little or no danger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During two weeks troops had been gathering near
about Cardenas to protect it against American invasion;
masked batteries were being planted, earthworks
thrown up, and blockhouses erected. There was no
lack of targets.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Carefully, precisely, as if at practice, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span>
opened fire from her 4-inch guns, throwing shells
here, there, everywhere; but more particularly in the
direction of that masked battery which had trained its
guns on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Winslow</span></span>, and as the Spaniards, panic-stricken,
hearing a death-knell in the sighing, whistling
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>missiles, fled in mad terror, the gunboats’ machine guns
were called into play.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is safe to assert that the one especial object of the
American sailors’ vengeance was completely destroyed.
Not a gun remained mounted, not a man was alive,
save those whose wounds were mortal. The punishment
was terrible, but complete.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Until this moment the Spaniards at Cardenas had
believed they might with impunity open fire on any
craft flying the American flag; but now they began to
understand that such sport was in the highest degree
dangerous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During a full hour—and in that time nearly three
hundred shells had been sent on errands of destruction—the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> continued her bombardment of the
defences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the work was completed two gunboats had
been sunk so quickly that their crews had no more than
sufficient time to escape. Two schooners were converted
into wrecks at their moorings. One blockhouse
was consumed by flames, and signal-stations, masked
batteries, and forts were in ruins.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While this lesson was in progress the Spaniards did
their best to bring it to a close; but despite all efforts
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilmington</span></span> was unharmed. There was absolutely
no evidence of conflict about her when she finally
steamed away, save such as might have been read
on the smoke-begrimed faces of the hard-worked but
triumphant and satisfied crew.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 13.</span></span> An English correspondent, cabling from
Hongkong regarding the Spaniards in the Philippine
Islands, made the following statement:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“They are in a position to give the Americans
a deal of trouble. There are twenty-five thousand
Spanish soldiers in the garrison at Manila, and one
hundred thousand volunteers enrolled. Scores of coasting
steamers are imprisoned on the river Pasig, which
is blocked at the mouth by some sunken schooners.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Wildman, the American consul here, tells me
that, according to his despatches, a flag of truce is flying
over Manila, and the people are allowed to proceed
freely to and from the ships in the harbour.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Americans are on duty night and day on the
lookout for boats which endeavour to run the blockade
with food supplies. The hospital is supported by the
Americans. The Spaniards are boasting that their big
battle-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Pelayo</span></span> is coming, and will demolish the
Americans in ten minutes.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the afternoon of May 13th the flying squadron,
Commodore W. S. Schley commanding, set sail from
Old Point Comfort, heading southeast. The following
vessels comprised the fleet. The cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>, the

At eight o’clock in the evening the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Minneapolis</span></span> followed,

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 14.</span></span> Eleven steamers, chartered by the government
as troop-ships, sailed from New York for Key

supplies and reinforcements for Admiral Dewey’s fleet
at Manila, had been made ready for sea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At Havana General Blanco had shown great energy
in preparing for the expected siege by American forces.
The city and forts were reported as being provisioned
sufficiently for three or four months, and Havana was
surrounded by entrenchments for a distance of thirty
miles. The troops in the garrison numbered seventy
thousand, and a like number were in the interior fighting
the insurgents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The condition of the reconcentrados in Havana had
grown steadily worse. The mortality increased among
this wretched class, who had taken to begging morsels
of food.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nobody in Havana except a few higher officers knew
that the Spanish fleet was annihilated at Manila, and the
story was believed that the Americans were beaten there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At Madrid in the Chamber of Deputies Señor Bores
asked the government to inform the house of the condition
of the Philippines. After the pacification of the
islands, he said, outbreaks had occurred at Pansy and
Cebu and even in Manila. Was this a new rebellion,
he asked, or a continuation of the old one? If it was
a continuation of the old rebellion, then General Prima
de Rivera’s pacification of the islands had been a perfect
fraud.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>General Correa, Minister of War, replied that the
old insurrection was absolutely over. The present one,
he said, arose from the incitements of the Americans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Señor Bores retorted that he had received a private
letter from the Philippines, dated April 10th, prior to
the arising of any fear of war with the United States,
giving pessimistic accounts of the risings there, and
passengers arriving by the steamer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Leon III.</span></span> had told
similar stories. Now, he declared, the Spanish troops
in the Philippines were in a terrible condition, being
between two fires, the natives and the Americans.
Señor Bores’s remarks created a profound sensation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Charleston</span></span> was reported as being ready
to sail from San Francisco for Manila. Three hundred

A press correspondent gives the following spirited
account, under the date of May 14th, of a second
attempt to entice the American blockading squadron
within range of the Santa Clara battery guns:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Captain-General Blanco, two hours before sunset
to-night, attempted to execute a ruse, which, if successful,
would have cleared the front of Havana of six ships
on that blockading station.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Unable to come out to do battle, he adopted the
tactics of the spider, and cunningly planned to draw
the prey into his net, but, though a clever and pretty
scheme as an original proposition, it was practically a
repetition of the trick by which the gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span>
and the little converted revenue cutter <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Morrill</span></span> were
last week decoyed by a fishing-smack under the big
Krupp guns of Santa Clara batteries.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Thanks to bad gunnery, both ships on that occasion
managed to get out of range without being sunk, though
some of the shells burst close aboard, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg’s</span></span>
Jacob’s-ladder was cut adrift.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Late this afternoon the ships on the Havana station
were dumfounded to see two vessels steam out
of Havana Harbour and head east. Dense smoke was
streaming like black ribbons from their stacks, and a
glance showed that they were under full head of steam.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“By aid of glasses Commander Lilly of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Mayflower</span></span>,
which was flying the pennant, made out the
larger vessel of the two, which was two hundred feet
long and about forty-five hundred tons displacement,
to be the cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Alphonso XII.</span></span>, and the small one to
be the gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Legaspi</span></span>, both of which were known
to be bottled up in Havana Harbour.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“At first he supposed that they were taking advantage
of the absence of the heavy fighting-ships, and
were making a bona-fide run for the open sea.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“As superior officer, he immediately signalled the
other war-ships on the station, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Annapolis</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wasp</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Tecumseh</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Osceola</span></span>. The little squadron gave
chase to the flying Spaniards, keeping up a running
fire as they advanced. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Alphonso</span></span> and her consort
circled inshore about five miles below Havana, and
headed back for Morro Castle.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Our gunboats and the vessels of the mosquito fleet
did not follow them in. Commander Lilly saw that
the wily Spanish ruse was to draw them in under the
guns of the heavy batteries, where Spanish artillery
officers could plot out the exact range with their telemeters.
So the return was made in line ahead, parallel
with the shore.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Commander Lilly had not been mistaken. As his
ships came abreast of Santa Clara battery the big guns
opened, and fired thirteen shells at a distance of about
five miles. The range was badly judged, as more than
half the missiles overshot the mark, and others fell
short, some as much as a mile.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The big <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Alphonso</span></span> and her convoy steamed swiftly
from the dark shadow of the harbour’s mouth, and, turning
sharply east, ran along the coast as though to slip
through the cordon of blockade.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It was a bold trick and not at first transparent,
although the folly of it created a suspicion.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The Spanish boats crowded on steam and stood
along the coast as long as they dared, to give zest to
the chase. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Mayflower</span></span> signalled her consorts,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Close in and charge.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Seeing that the bait had apparently taken, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Spaniards veered about, and, bringing their stern-chasers
to bear on the Americans, doubled back for
Morro.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Two of the shells from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span> burst in the
rigging of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Alphonso</span></span>, and some of it came down,
but it was, of course, impossible to know whether any
fatalities occurred. The American fire was much more
accurate than the Spanish, as every shell of the latter
fell short of their pursuers.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The Spaniards were a mile off Morro, and our ships
fully four miles out, when flame leaped from the batteries
of the Santa Clara forts, and clouds of white
smoke drifted up the coast. Half a minute later a dull,
heavy roar of a great gun came like a deep diapason
of an organ on high treble of smaller guns. It was
from one of the 12-inch Krupp guns mounted there,
and an 85-pound projectile plunged into the water half
a mile inside of the American line, throwing up a tower
of white spray. It ricochetted and struck again half
a mile outside.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The mask was now off. Maddened by the failure
of their plot, the Spaniards continued to fire at intervals
of about ten minutes. In all, thirteen shots were
fired, but not one struck within two hundred yards of
our ships.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“As soon as the battery opened, Commander Lilly
signalled, and his fleet stood offshore. Captain McKensie,
on the bridge of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicksburg</span></span>, watched the fall
of the shells, but he considered it useless to waste
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ammunition at that distance. He appeased the desire
of the men at the guns, however, by letting go a
final broadside at the Spanish ships, in the chance
hope of making them pay for their daring before they
gained the harbour, but they steamed under Morro’s
guns untouched, and, as they disappeared, discharged
several guns.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Half a dozen shots were sent after them at that
moment by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Annapolis</span></span>, which dropped inside the
harbour, probably creating consternation among scores
of boats on the water-front.”</span>

At seven <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Louis</span></span> fired her first gun at the
forts protecting the entrance to Santiago Harbour, and
after a little time the fire was returned by what must
have been a 2-pounder.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At eight <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Louis</span></span> was about two miles
distant from the fort, which seemed to be unprovided
with modern guns. After three hours grappling in
over five hundred fathoms, the cable had not been
found. At 12.15 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P. M.</span></span> the guns of Morro Castle
opened fire, followed by the shore battery on the
southerly point, and also the west battery. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">St.

soon succeeded in silencing the guns of Morro Castle,
the Spaniards running in all directions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of the shots from the fort fell short of the ship.
Shells from the mortar battery went over the cruiser
and exploded in the water quite close to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Louis</span></span>.
The mortar battery ceased at 12.56 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P. M.</span></span>, after a fusilade
of forty-one minutes. After firing the cable was
grappled, hauled on board, and cut.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At about midnight on May 29th the officer of the
deck on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> saw, by aid of his night-glass,
two low-lying, swiftly-running steamers stealing
out of Santiago Harbour, and keeping well within the
shadows of the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As soon as might be thereafter the war-vessel’s
search-lights were turned full on, and at the same
moment the sleeping crew were awakened.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was known beyond a question that the Spanish
fleet under Admiral Cervera was hidden within the
harbour, not daring to come boldly out while the blockading
squadron was so strong, and the first thought of
men as well as officers, when these stealthily moving
vessels were sighted, was that the Spaniards were
making a desperate effort to escape from the trap they
had voluntarily entered.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The search-lights of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> revealed the fact that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the two strangers were torpedo-boats, and a heavy fire
was opened upon them instantly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the report of the first gun the call to quarters
was sounded on all the other ships, and a dozen rays of
blinding light flashed here and there across the entrance
to the harbour, until the waters were so brilliantly
illumined that the smallest craft in which mariner ever
set sail could not have come out unobserved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same report which aroused the squadron told
the Spaniards that their purpose was no longer a secret,
and the two torpedo-boats were headed for the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>
and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, running at full speed in the hope of
discharging their tubes before the fire should become
too heavy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The enemy had not calculated, however, upon such a
warm and immediate reception. It was as if every gun
on board both the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> was in action
within sixty seconds after the Spaniards were sighted,
and there remained nothing for the venturesome
craft save to seek the shelter of the harbour again,
fortunate indeed if such opportunity was allowed
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May 31.</span></span> The U. S. S. <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>, cruising inshore

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

mouth to within four thousand yards of Morro Castle.

Two miles out to sea lay the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, and
other ships of the blockading fleet awaiting the summons

none came.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts</span></span> opened fire first, taking the Spanish
flag-ship for its target. An 8-inch shell was the
missile, and it fell far short of its mark. Then the big
machine tried her 13-inch guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span> and four batteries—two on the
east side, one on the west, and one on an island in
the middle of the channel, replied. Their 10 and
12-inch Krupps spoke shot for shot with our sixes,
eights and thirteens. It was noisy and spectacular,
but not effective on either side.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The American fleet steamed across before the batteries
at full speed; circled, and passed again. Both
sides had found the range by the time of the second
passing, and began to shoot close. Several shots
burst directly over the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>, three fell dangerously
near the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New Orleans</span></span>, and one sprayed the bow of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After half an hour both forts on the east and the one
on the island were silenced. Five minutes later our
ships ceased firing. The western battery and the
Spanish flag-ship kept up the din fifteen minutes
longer, but their work was ineffective.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A naval officer with the squadron summed up the
situation in a communication to his friend at home:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pending the execution of Admiral Sampson’s plan
of campaign, our ships form a cordon about the entrance
of Santiago Harbour to prevent the possible egress of
the Spaniards, should Admiral Cervera be foolhardy
enough to attempt to cut his way out.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The officers of the blockading squadron were well
informed as to the situation ashore. Communication
with the Cubans had been established, and it was
known that a line of insurgents had been drawn
around Santiago, in order that they might be of
assistance when the big war-vessels had struck the
first blow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The defences of the harbour were fairly well-known
despite the vigilance of the enemy, and it was no secret
that within the narrow neck of the channel, which at
the entrance is hardly more than three hundred feet
wide, eighteen or twenty mines had been planted.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A report from one of the newspaper correspondents,
under date of June 1st, was as follows:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“So far as has been ascertained, there are three
new batteries on the west side of the entrance.
These appear to be formed entirely of earthworks.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The embrasures for the guns can easily be discerned
with the glasses. Cayo Smith, a small island
which lies directly beyond the entrance, is fortified,
and back of Morro, which sits on the rocky eminences
at the right of the entrance, are Estrella battery
and St. Carolina fort. Further up the bay, guarding
the last approach to the city of Santiago, is Blanco
battery.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The first are of stone, and were constructed in the
early sixties. St. Carolina fort is partially in ruins. The
guns in Morro Castle and Estrella are of old pattern, 18
and 24-pounders, and would not even be considered
were it not for the great height of the fortifications,
which would enable these weapons to deliver a plunging
fire.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Modern guns are mounted on the batteries to the
left of the entrance. On Cayo Smith and at Blanco
battery there are also four modern guns. The mines
in the narrow, tortuous channel, and the elevation of the
forts and batteries, which must increase the effectiveness
of the enemy’s fire, and at the same time decrease
that of our own, reinforced by the guns of the Spanish
fleet inside, make the harbour, as it now appears, almost
impregnable. Unless the entrance is countermined it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would be folly to attempt to force its passage with our
ships.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But the Spanish fleet is bottled up, and a plan is
being considered to drive in the cork. If that is done,
the next news may be a thrilling story of closing the
harbour. It would release a part of our fleet, and leave
the Spaniards to starve and rot until they were ready
to hoist the white flag.”</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“To drive in the cork,”</span> was the subject nearest Rear-Admiral
Sampson’s heart, and he at once went into
consultation with his officers as to how it could best
be done. One plan after another was discussed and
rejected, and then Assistant Naval Constructor Richmond
Pearson Hobson proposed that the big collier
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>, which then had on board about six hundred
tons of coal, be sunk across the channel in such a
manner as to completely block it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The plan was a good one; but yet it seemed certain
death for those who should attempt to carry it out as
proposed. Lieutenant Hobson, however, claimed that, if
the scheme was accepted, he should by right be allowed
to take command of the enterprise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The end to be attained was so great that Admiral
Sampson decided that the lives of six or seven men
could not be allowed to outweigh the advantage to
be gained, and Lieutenant Hobson was notified that
his services were accepted; the big steamer was at his
disposal to do with as he saw fit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 11.</span></span> The preliminary work of this desperate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>undertaking was a strain upon the officers and men.
On Wednesday morning the preparations to scuttle the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> in the channel were commenced. All day
long crews from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> were
on board the collier, never resting in their efforts
to prepare her. She lay alongside the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts</span></span>,
discharging coal, when the work was first begun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The news of the intended expedition travelled quickly
through the fleet, and it soon became known that
volunteers were needed for a desperate undertaking.
From the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa’s</span></span> signal-yard quickly fluttered the announcement
that she had 140 volunteers, and the other
ships were not far behind. On the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> the enthusiasm
was intense. Over two hundred members of the
crew volunteered to go into that narrow harbour and
face death. The junior officers literally tumbled over
each other in their eagerness to get their names on the
volunteer list.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When it was learned that only six men and Lieutenant
Hobson were to go, there was much disappointment
on all sides. All Wednesday night the crews worked
on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>; and the other ships, as they
passed the collier, before sundown, cheered her. Lieutenant
Hobson paid a brief visit to the flag-ship shortly
before midnight, and then returned to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While on board the flag-ship Lieutenant Hobson
thus detailed his plan of action:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall go right into the harbour until about four
hundred yards past the Estrella battery, which is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>behind Morro Castle. I do not think they can sink
me before I reach somewhere near that point. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> has seven thousand tons buoyancy, and I
shall keep her full speed ahead. She can make about
ten knots. When the narrowest part of the channel
is reached I shall put her helm hard aport, stop the
engines, drop the anchors, open the sea connections,
touch off the torpedoes, and leave the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> a
wreck, lying athwart the channel, which is not as
broad as the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> is long. There are ten 8-inch
improvised torpedoes below the water-line, on the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac’s</span></span> port-side. They are placed on her side
against the bulk-heads and vital spots, connected with
each other by a wire under the ship’s keel. Each torpedo
contains eighty-two pounds of gunpowder. Each
torpedo is also connected with the bridge; they should
do their work in a minute, and it will be quick work
even if done in a minute and a quarter.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“On deck there will be four men and myself. In
the engine-room there will be two other men. This
is the total crew, and all of us will be in our underclothing,
with revolvers and ammunition in water-tight
packing strapped around our waists. Forward there
will be a man on deck, and around his waist will be
a line, the other end of the line being made fast to the
bridge, where I will stand. By that man’s side will be
an axe. When I stop the engines I shall jerk this
cord, and he will thus get the signal to cut the lashing
which will be holding the forward anchor. He will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>then jump overboard and swim to the four-oared dingy,
which we shall tow astern. The dingy is full of life-buoys,
and is unsinkable. In it are rifles. It is to be
held by two ropes, one made fast at her bow and one
at her stern. The first man to reach her will haul in
the tow-line and pull the dingy to starboard. The next
to leave the ship are the rest of the crew. The quartermaster
at the wheel will not leave until after having
put it hard aport, and lashed it so; he will then jump
overboard.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Down below, the man at the reversing gear will
stop the engines, scramble up on deck, and get over
the side as quickly as he is able. The man in the
engine-room will break open the sea connections with
a sledge-hammer, and will follow his leader into the
water. This last step ensures the sinking of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>
whether the torpedoes work or not. By this
time I calculate the six men will be in the dingy and
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> will have swung athwart the channel, to
the full length of her three hundred yards of cable,
which will have been paid out before the anchors are
cut loose. Then, all that is left for me is to touch the
button. I shall stand on the starboard side of the
bridge. The explosion will throw the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> on
her starboard side. Nothing on this side of New York
City will be able to raise her after that.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In reply to frequent questions, Hobson said:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose the Estrella battery will fire down on us
a bit, but the ships will throw their search-lights in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gunners’ faces, and they won’t see much of us. If
we are torpedoed we should even then be able to
make the desired position in the channel. It won’t be
easy to hit us, and I think the men should be able to
swim to the dingy. I may jump before I am blown up.
But I don’t see that it makes much difference what I
do. I have a fair chance of life either way. If our
dingy gets shot to pieces we shall then try to swim for
the beach right under Morro Castle. We shall keep
together at all hazards. Then we may be able to
make our way alongside, and perhaps get back to the
ship. We shall fight the sentries or a squad until the
last, and shall only surrender to overwhelming numbers,
and our surrender will only take place as a last
and almost uncontemplated emergency.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The volunteers accepted for this most hazardous
enterprise were, after Lieutenant Hobson: George F.
Phillips, machinist on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>; Francis Kelly,
water tender on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>; Randolph Clausen,
coxswain on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>; George Charette, first-class
gunner’s mate on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>; Daniel Montague,

coxswain on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 21.</span></span> At three o’clock in the morning the
admiral and Flag Lieutenant Staunton got into the
launch to make an inspection of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>. The
working gangs were still on board of her, and the officers
of the flag-ship stood with their glasses focused on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the big black hull that was to form an impassable
obstacle for Spain’s best ships.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The minutes slipped by, the crews had not completed
their work on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>, but at last a boatload of
men, black and tired out, came over to the flag-ship.
Last of all, at 4.30, came the admiral. He had been
delayed by a breakdown of the steam launch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dawn was breaking over Santiago de Cuba, and
nearly everybody thought it was too late for the
attempt to be made that morning. Then somebody
cried:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“She is going in.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Surely enough, the seemingly deserted collier was
seen heading straight for Morro Castle. A few moments
later, however, she was recalled by Admiral
Sampson, who thought it sure death for Hobson to
venture in at that hour. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> did not return
at once. Word came back:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lieutenant Hobson asks permission to continue on
his course. He thinks he can make it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The admiral sent Hobson a message to the effect
that the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> must return at once, and in due
course of time the doomed collier slowly steamed back,
her commander evidently disappointed with the order.
All day Thursday the collier lay near the flag-ship, and
more elaborate preparations were made to carry out the
mission of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> successfully. During these
preparations Hobson was cool and confident, supervising
personally every little detail.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When, finally, he went on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> Thursday
night, he had been without sleep since Wednesday
morning. His uniform was begrimed, his hands were
black, and he looked like a man who had been hard at
work in and about an engine-room for a long time.
As he said good-bye, the lieutenant remarked that his
only regret was that all of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York’s</span></span> volunteers
could not go with him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 3.</span></span> The hazardous voyage was begun at three
o’clock Friday morning. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> was lying to
the westward. Under cover of the clouds over the
moon, she stole in toward the coast and made her
way to the eastward, followed by a steam launch
from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>, with the following crew on board:
Naval Cadet J. W. Powell, of Oswego, N. Y.; P. K.
Peterson, coxswain; H. Handford, apprentice of the
first class; J. Mullings, coal passer; G. L. Russell,
machinist of the second class. In the launch were
bandages and appliances for the wounded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the crowded decks of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> nothing
could be seen of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> after she got under the
shadow of the hills. For half an hour officers and men
strained their eyes peering into the gloom, when, suddenly,
the flash of a gun streamed out from Morro
Castle, and then all on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> knew the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> was nearing her end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The guns from the Spanish battery opposite Morro
Castle answered quickly with more flashes, and for
about twenty minutes tongues of fire seemed to leap
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>across the harbour entrance. The flag-ship was too
far away to hear the reports, and when the firing
ceased it was judged that Hobson had blown up the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During an hour the anxious watchers waited for
daylight. Rear-Admiral Sampson and Captain Chadwick
were on the bridge of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> during
the entire time. At five o’clock thin streams of
smoke were seen against the western shore, quite
close to the Spanish batteries, and strong glasses
made out the launch of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> returning to
the flag-ship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Scarcely had the small craft been sighted before a
puff of smoke issued from a battery on the western
arm of the harbour, and a shot plunged far over the
launch. Then for fifteen minutes the big guns ashore
kept up an irregular fire on the little craft. As the
shells fell without hitting the object for which they
were intended, the men on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>
jeered at the Spanish marksmanship, and cheered
their shipmates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At 6.15 the launch came alongside the flag-ship, but
she did not have on board any of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac’s</span></span> crew.
Cadet Powell reported that he had been unable to see
any of the men. It was learned that the cadet had
gone directly under the batteries, and only returned
when he found his efforts were useless.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He also reported that he had clearly seen the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac’s</span></span>
masts sticking up just where Hobson hoped to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sink her, north of the Estrella battery, and well past
the guns of Morro Castle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cadet Powell thus related the last interview he had
with the officer whom it seemed certain had voluntarily
gone to his death:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Lieutenant Hobson took a short sleep for a few
hours, which was often interrupted. At a quarter
before two he came on deck and made a final inspection,
giving his last instructions. Then we had a little
lunch. Hobson was as cool as a cucumber. At about
half past two I took the men who were not going on
the trip into the launch, and started for the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, the
nearest ship, but had to go back for one of the assistant
engineers, whom Hobson finally compelled to leave. I
shook hands with Hobson last of all. He said:</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Powell, watch the boat’s crew when we pull out
of the harbour. We will be cracks, pulling thirty strokes
to the minute.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“After leaving the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> I saw the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> steaming
slowly in.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It was only fairly dark then, and the shore was
quite visible. We followed about three-quarters of a
mile astern. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> stood about a mile to the
westward of the harbour, and seemed a bit mixed, turning
completely around, and finally heading to the east,
she ran down and then turned in. We were then
chasing him because I thought Hobson had lost his
bearings.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“When Hobson was about two hundred yards from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the harbour the first gun was fired, from the eastern
bluff. We were then about half a mile offshore, and
nearing the batteries. The firing increased rapidly.
We steamed in slowly, and lost sight of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>
in the smoke which the wind carried offshore. It hung
heavily. Before Hobson could have blown up the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> the western battery picked us up and commenced firing.
They shot wild, however, and we ran
in still farther to the shore until the gunners lost sight
of us. Then we heard the explosion of the torpedoes
on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Until daylight we waited just outside the breakers,
half a mile to the westward of Morro, keeping a sharp
lookout for the boat or for swimmers, but saw nothing.
Hobson had arranged to meet us at that point, but
thinking that some one might have drifted out, we
crossed in front of Morro and the mouth of the harbour,
to the eastward.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“At about five o’clock we crossed the harbour again,
and stood to the westward. In passing we saw one
spar of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> sticking out of the water. We
hugged the shore just outside of the breakers for a
mile, and then turned toward the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, when the
batteries saw us and opened fire. It was then broad
daylight. The first shot dropped thirty yards astern,
but the others went wild. I drove the launch for all
she was worth, finally making the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>. The
men behaved splendidly.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 3.</span></span> Later in the day a boat with a white flag put
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>out from the harbour, and Captain Oviedo, chief of
staff of Admiral Cervera, boarded the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>, and
informed Admiral Sampson that the whole party had
been captured; that only two were injured. Lieutenant
Hobson was not hurt. The Spanish admiral was
so impressed with the courage of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac’s</span></span> crew
that he decided to inform Admiral Sampson of the fact
that they had not lost their lives, but were prisoners of
war and could be exchanged.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To a newspaper correspondent Commodore Schley
said, as he stood on his flag-ship pointing towards
Morro Castle:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“History does not record an act of finer heroism
than that of the gallant men who are prisoners over
there. I watched the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> as she made her way
to the entrance of the harbour, and my heart sank as I
saw the perfect hell of fire that fell upon those devoted
men. I did not think it possible one of them could
have gone through it alive.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They went into the jaws of death. It was Balaklava
over again without the means of defence which
the Light Brigade had. Hobson led a forlorn hope
without the power to cut his way out; but fortune
once more favoured the brave, and I hope he will have
the recognition and promotion he deserves. His name
will live as long as the heroes of the world are
remembered.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“As stated in a special telegram, before coming here
I decided to make the harbour entrance secure against
the possibility of egress by Spanish ships, by obstructing
the narrow part of the entrance by sinking a collier
at that point.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Upon calling upon Mr. Hobson for his professional

manifested the most lively interest in the problem.
After several days’ consideration, he presented a solution

sinking of the ship when she reached the desired point
in the channel. This plan we prepared for execution
when we reached Santiago.</span>

headed east until I got my bearings, and then made

grand, flashing out first from one side of the harbour

to the work done by the mine, she began to sink slowly.
At that time she was across the channel, but before she
settled the tide drifted her around. We were all aft,
lying on the deck. Shells and bullets whistled around.
Six-inch shells from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span> came tearing into the

    <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Not a man must move,’</span> I said, and it was only
owing to the splendid discipline of the men that we all
were not killed, as the shells rained over us, and the
minutes became hours of suspense. The men’s mouths
became parched, but we must lie there till daylight, I
told them. Now and again, one or the other of the
men, lying with his face glued to the deck and wondering
whether the next shell might not come our way,
would say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Hadn’t we better drop off now, sir?’</span> But
I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Wait till daylight.’</span></span>

This best can be described by referring to instances

McGee, however, rushed toward the box, picked it up,
and was staggering in the direction of the river, some

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 14.</span></span> From Manila on June 14th much of interest
was received. A severe engagement occurred, when
one thousand insurgents attacked twice that number of
Spaniards, inflicting heavy losses. The insurgents had
drawn their lines closely around the landward side of
the city, and Captain-General Augusti published a
decree ordering all the male population under arms.
Mr. E. W. Harden, correspondent of the New York
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">World</span></span>, thus summed up the situation:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Terrific fighting has been going on for six days
between the Philippine insurgents and the Spaniards.
The rebels, under Aguinaldo, more than held their
ground, while the Spaniards lost heavily. The insurgents
now hold three thousand prisoners, mostly
Spanish soldiers.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I have been in the field with the rebels, and I was
present at the taking of the garrisoned church at Old
Cavite, June 7th, where three hundred insurgents captured
a superior force of Spaniards after an eight days’
bombardment. The rebels are competent, courageous
fighters. They have captured the entire provinces of
Cavite and Bataan, and parts of the provinces of
Pampagna, Bulucan, and Manila.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Aguinaldo’s troops, in three divisions, have now
surrounded Manila. They have the Spaniards hemmed
in, and could capture the city if they wanted to, but
will await the arrival of the American troops before
doing so.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The rebels have captured Gov. Leopoldo Garcia
Penas, of Cavite province, and Gov. Antonio Cardola,
of Bataan province. Cardola tried to commit suicide
before surrendering. He shot himself three times in
the head, but will recover. The insurgents behaved
gallantly in the fight for the possession of the stone
convent in Old Cavite, June 1st. General Augusti sent
two thousand Spanish regulars of the Manila force to
attack Aguinaldo’s forces at Cavite. The fight lasted
all day. The Spaniards were repulsed, and the officers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>led in retreat. They took refuge in the old convent, a
substantial building, with walls five feet thick, built for
all time.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Aguinaldo surrounded the convent, and his first
plan was to starve out the beleaguered ones, but he
found, June 6th, that provisions were being smuggled
in to them, and so he attacked the building, beginning
by opening fire with his mountain guns. Meantime, General
Augusti, hearing of his soldiers’ plight, sent four
thousand regulars to relieve them.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Aguinaldo led the attack on these four thousand.
But after the first brush he adopted another method.
He sent detachments of three hundred or four hundred
men, armed with machetes, on the flanks of the Spaniards,
who constantly harassed them. In the first attack
of these detachments one hundred and fifty Spanish
soldiers and a lieutenant-colonel were killed. In the
second onslaught four officers and sixty men were
killed.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Again and again these attacks were repeated until
nine hundred Spaniards had been killed, the insurgents
report. The convent, too, became untenable. The
Spaniards retreated along the road to Manila, but made
a stand at Bacoor.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Aguinaldo and his men fought them fiercely there,
and the Spanish fled again. The rebels pursued the
enemy to within sight of Manila. Returning, Aguinaldo
stormed the old convent, and of the Spaniards
who remained there he killed ninety and captured 250.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 22.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“We came off the port on the twenty-second.
The weather was fair, the trade wind blowing fresh
from the eastward and raising somewhat of a sea. At
about 12.40 the third-class cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Isabel III.</span></span> came out,
and, steaming under the Morro until she was abreast
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the batteries, commenced edging out toward us,
firing at such a long range that her shots were ineffective.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“As her purpose evidently was to put us within fire
of the batteries, we took but little notice of her, lying
still and occasionally sending in our largest shell at her
to try the range.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Soon afterward she dropped to the westward, and
the torpedo-boat destroyer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Terror</span></span>, or it may have been
her sister ship, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Furor</span></span>, was sighted steaming along
shore under the batteries.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“We watched her for awhile, and worked along with
her, in order to separate her from the cruiser and keep
her in trough if she came for us. She then circled to
get up speed, and headed for us, firing straight as far
as direction went, but her shots fell short.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“When within range of our guns, the signal <span class="tei tei-q">‘commence
firing’</span> was made, and for several minutes we let
fly our starboard battery at her at from fifty-five hundred
to six thousand yards, the shells striking all around
her.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“This stopped her. She turned her broadside to us
and her fire soon ceased. She then headed inshore,
to the southward and westward, going slow, and it was
evident to all on board that she was crippled. Off
the Morro she flashed some signals to the shore,
and afterward a tug came out and towed her into the
harbour.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“All this time the cruiser was firing at us, and some
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of her shots and those of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Terror</span></span> fell pretty close.
The cruiser followed the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Terror</span></span> back toward the port
and soon afterward was joined by a gunboat, and the
two steamed under the batteries to the eastward; but
when the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Paul</span></span>, making an inshore turn, seemed to
be going for them, they returned to the harbour, and we

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Inside the harbour, caught like rats in a trap of
their own making, lay the Spanish fleet under command
of Admiral Pasquale Cervera, consisting of the armoured
cruisers <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Almirante Oquendo</span></span>,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Americans were on the alert, lest by some inadvertence
their prey should escape, and it may well be
supposed that the Spaniards, knowing full well they
were not in sufficient strength to give battle, awaited a
favourable opportunity to slip through the blockading
squadron.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 2.</span></span> The first detachment of troops, including
heavy and light artillery and the engineer corps, embarked
for Santiago on the second of June. Four days
later this force was landed at Aguadores, a few miles
east of Santiago, under the cover of Admiral Sampson’s
guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 6.</span></span> The American fleet began the bombardment
of the batteries guarding the entrance to the harbour
at six o’clock in the morning, having steamed in
to within three thousand yards of the shore, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>
in advance of the first column, with the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>,
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts</span></span> in line. The
second column was led by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>, with the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New
Orleans</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Yankee</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> in the order named.
On the left flank were the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span>, and
on the right the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Dolphin</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Porter</span></span> kept watchful
eyes upon the riflemen ashore. The first column took
station opposite the Estrella and Catalina batteries,<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>
while the second was stationed off the new earthworks
near Morro Castle. Orders had been given that no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shots should be thrown into El Morro, because of the
fact that Lieutenant Hobson and his crew were imprisoned
there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fleet continued the bombardment without moving
from the stations originally taken. It was the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>
which opened the action with a 12-inch shell, and
the skill of the gunners was shown by the shower of
stone which spouted up from the base of the Estrella
battery. As if this shot was the signal agreed upon,
the other vessels of the fleet opened fire, the enemy
answering promptly but ineffectively.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Very quickly were the shore-batteries silenced by the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>. Estrella Fort was soon on
fire; the Catalina battery gave up the struggle in less
than an hour, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> engaged
with some light inshore works, speedily reducing them
to ruins. Until nine o’clock the bombardment continued
without interruption, and then the American fire
ceased until the ships could be turned, in order that
their port batteries might be brought into play.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One hour more, that is to say, until ten o’clock, this
terrible rain of iron was sent from the fleet to the
shore, and then on the flag-ship was hoisted the signal:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Cease firing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The American fleet withdrew absolutely uninjured,—not
a ship had been hit by the Spaniards nor a man
wounded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On board the Spanish ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Reina Mercedes</span></span>, a lieutenant
and five seamen had been killed, and seventeen
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wounded; the vessel was set on fire no less than three
times, and otherwise seriously damaged by the missiles.
Near about Morro Castle, although none of the American
guns were aimed at that structure, two were killed
and four wounded, while on Smith Cay great havoc was
wrought.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Admiral Cervera made the following report to his
government:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Six American vessels have bombarded the fortifications
at Santiago and along the adjacent coast.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Six were killed and seventeen were wounded on
board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Reina Mercedes</span></span>; three officers were killed
and an officer and seventeen men were wounded among
the troops.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The Americans fired fifteen hundred shells of different
calibres. The damage inflicted upon the batteries
of La Socapa and Morro Castle were unimportant.
The barracks at Morro Castle suffered damage.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The enemy had noticeable losses.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 8.</span></span> Nearly, if not quite, twenty-seven thousand
men were embarked at Tampa for Santiago on the
eighth of June, under the command of Maj.-Gen.
William R. Shafter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fire was opened by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Yankee</span></span>
of the blockading squadron upon the fortifications of
Camianera, a port on Cumberland Harbour fifteen miles
distant from Guantanamo. The enemy was forced to
retire to the town, but no great injury was inflicted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span> entered Santiago Harbour under a flag of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>truce from Admiral Sampson, to arrange for an exchange
of Lieutenant Hobson and his men. Admiral
Cervera said in reply that the matter had been referred
to General Blanco.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> landed weapons, ammunition, and provisions
for the insurgents at a point fifteen miles west
of Santiago.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Santiago were about twenty thousand Spanish
soldiers, mostly infantry; but with cavalry and artillery
that may be drawn from the surrounding country. On
the mountains five thousand insurgents, many unarmed,
watched for a favourable opportunity to make a descent
upon the city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Orders were sent by the Navy Department to Admiral
Sampson to notify Admiral Cervera that, if the
latter destroyed his four armoured cruisers and two
torpedo-boat destroyers to prevent their capture, Spain,
at the end of the war, would be made to pay an additional
indemnity at least equivalent to the value of
these vessels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 10.</span></span> The American troops made a landing on
the eastern side of Guantanamo Harbour, forty miles
east of Santiago, at two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P. M.</span></span> on the tenth of June. The
debarkation was effected under the cover of the guns
of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Dolphin</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The war-vessels prepared the way by opening fire
on the earthworks which lined the shore, a blockhouse,
and a cable station which was occupied by Spanish
soldiers. The defence was feeble; the enemy retreated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in hot haste after firing a few shots. A small gunboat
came down from Guantanamo, four miles away, at the
beginning of the bombardment, but she put back with
all speed after having approached within range.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Soon after the enemy had been driven away, the
steamer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Panther</span></span> arrived with a battalion of marines
under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Huntington.
She reported having shelled a blockhouse at Daiquiri,
ten miles east of Santiago, but without provoking any
reply.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Colonel Huntington’s force took possession of the
heights overlooking the bay, where was a fortified
camp which had been abandoned by the Spaniards.
There was nothing to betoken the presence of the
enemy in strong numbers, and the men soon settled
down to ordinary camp duties, believing their first
serious work would be begun by an attack on Guantanamo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 11.</span></span> It was three o’clock on Saturday afternoon;
Colonel Huntington’s marines were disposed
about the camp according to duty or fancy; some
were bathing, and a detail was engaged in the work of
carrying water. Suddenly the sharp report of a musket
was heard, followed by another and another until
the rattle of firearms told that a skirmish of considerable
importance was in progress on the picket-line.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The principal portion of the enemy’s fire appeared
to come from a small island about a thousand yards
away, and a squad of men was detailed with a 3-inch
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>field-gun to look out for the enemy in this direction,
while the main force defended the camp.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After perhaps an hour had passed, during which time
the boys of ’98 were virtually firing at random, the
men on the picket-line fell back on the camp. Two of
their number were missing. The battalion was formed
on three sides of a hollow square, and stood ready to
resist an attack which was not to be made until
considerably later.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The firing ceased as abruptly as it had begun. Skirmishers
were sent out and failed to find anything save
a broad trail, marked here and there by blood, which
came to an end at the water’s edge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were no longer detonations to be heard from
the island. The 3-inch gun had been well served.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The skirmishers which had been sent out returned,
bearing the bodies of two boys in blue who had been
killed by the first shots, and, after death, mutilated by
blows from Spanish machetes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Night came; heavy clouds hung low in the sky; the
force of the wind had increased almost to a gale; below
in the bay the war-ships were anchored, their search-lights
streaming out here and there like ribbons of gold
on a pall of black velvet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No signs of the enemy on land or sea, and, save for
those two cold, lifeless forms on the heights, one might
have believed the previous rattle of musketry had been
heard only by the imagination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Until nine o’clock in the evening the occupants of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the camp kept careful watch, and then without warning,
as before, the crack of repeating rifles broke the almost
painful stillness.
</p>
    <a name="ill36" id="ill36" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

    <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p><div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 100%; text-align: center"><img src="images/ill36.jpg" alt="U. S. S. MARBLEHEAD." title="U. S. S.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The enemy was making his presence known once
more, and this time it became evident he was in
larger force.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another 3-inch gun was brought into play; a launch
from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>, with a Colt machine gun in
her bow, steamed swiftly shoreward and opened fire;
skirmish lines were thrown out through the tangle of
foliage, and only when a dark form was seen, which
might have been that of a Spaniard, or only the swaying
branches of the trees, did the boys in blue have a
target.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was guerrilla warfare, and well-calculated to test
the nerves of the young soldiers who were receiving
their <span class="tei tei-q">“baptism of blood.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Until midnight this random firing continued, and
then a large body of Spanish troops charged up the hill
until they were face to face with the defenders of the
camp, when they retreated, being lost to view almost
immediately in the blackness of the night.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 12.</span></span> Again and again the firing was renewed
from this quarter or that, but the enemy did not show
himself until the morning came like a flash of light, as
it does in the tropics, disclosing scurrying bands of
Spanish soldiers as they sought shelter in the thicket.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now more guns were brought into play at the camp;
the war-ships began shelling the shore, and the action
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was speedily brought to an end. Four Americans had
been killed, and among them one of the surgeons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At intervals during the day the crack of a rifle would
tell that Spanish sharpshooters were hovering around
the camp; but not until eight o’clock in the evening
did the enemy approach in any great numbers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then the battle was on once more; again did the
little band of bluejackets stand to their posts, fighting
against an unseen foe. Again the war-ships flashed
their search-lights and sent shell after shell into the
thicket, and all the while the Spanish fire was continued
with deadly effect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lieutenants Neville and Shaw, each with a squad of
ten men, were sent out to dislodge the advance line
of the enemy, and as the boys in blue swung around
into the thicket with a steady, swinging stride, the
Spaniards gave way, firing rapidly while so doing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Americans, heeding not the danger, pursued,
following the foe nearly to a small stone house near
the coast, which had been used as a fort. They were
well up to this structure when the bullets rained upon
them in every direction from out the darkness. Sergeant
Goode fell fatally wounded, and the Spaniards
charged, forcing the Americans to the very edge of a
cliff, over which one man fell and was killed; another
fell, but with no further injury than a broken leg. A
third was shot through the arm, after which he and the
man with the broken limb joined forces, fighting on
their own account. One more was wounded, and then
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Americans made a desperate charge, forcing the
enemy back into the stone house, and then out again,
after fifteen had been killed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Meanwhile severe fighting was going on in the vicinity
of the camp; but six field-pieces were brought up,
and the second battle was ended after two Americans
had been killed and seven wounded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 13.</span></span> The camp was moved to a less exposed
position, while the war-ships poured shell and shrapnel
into the woods, and then the marines filed solemnly out
to a portion of the hill overlooking the bay where were
six newly made graves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All the marines could not attend the funeral, many
having to continue the work of moving camp, or to rest
on their guns, keeping a constant watch for the lurking
Spaniards; but all who could do so followed the
stumbling bearers of the dead over the loose gravel,
and grouped themselves about the graves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The stretcher bearing the bodies had just been lifted
to its place, and Chaplain Jones of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> was
about to begin the reading of the burial service, when
the Spaniards began shooting at the party from the
western chaparral.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Fall in, Company A, Company B, Company C, fall
in!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Fall in!”</span> was the word from one end of the camp
to the other. The graves were deserted by all save
the chaplain and escort, who still stood unmoved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The men sprang to arms, and then placed themselves
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>behind the rolled tents, their knapsacks, the bushes in
the hollows, boxes and piles of stones, their rifles
ready, their eyes strained into the brush.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Howitzers roared, blue smoke arose where the shells
struck and burst in the chaparral, and rifles sounded
angrily.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> fired seven shots at the place from which
the shooting came, and the Spaniards, as usual, fled
out of sight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The funeral services had hardly been resumed when
there was another attack; but this time the pits near
the old blockhouse got the range of the malignant marksmen
and shattered them with a few shots. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Panther</span></span> shelled the brush to the eastward, but the
chaplain kept right on with the service, and from that
time until night there was little shooting from the
cover.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On this day the dynamite cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vesuvius</span></span> joined
Admiral Sampson’s fleet, and the weary marines, holding
their posts on shore against overwhelming odds,
hoped that her arrival betokened the speedy coming of
the soldiers who were so sadly needed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 14.</span></span> Substantial recognition was given by the
Navy Department to the members of the gallant
crew who took the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> into the entrance of
Santiago Harbour and sunk her across the channel
under the very muzzles of the Spanish guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The orders sent to Admiral Sampson directed the
promotion of the men as follows:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

While a grateful people were discussing the manner
in which their heroes should be crowned, that little
band of marines on the shore of Guantanamo Bay,
worn almost to exhaustion by the harassing fire of the

against a vastly superior force in point of

From the afternoon of the eleventh of June until
this morning of the fourteenth, the Americans had
remained on the defensive,—seven hundred against
two thousand or more. Now, however, different tactics
were to be used. Colonel Huntington had decided
that it was time to turn the tables, and before the night
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was come the occupants of the graves on the crest of
the hill had been avenged.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A scouting party, made up of nine officers, two
hundred and eighty marines, and forty-one Cubans, was
divided into four divisions, the first of which had
orders to destroy a water-tank from which the enemy
drew supplies. The second was to attack the Spanish
camp beyond the first range of hills. The third had
for its objective point a signal-station from which information
as to the movements of the American fleet
had been flashed into Santiago. The fourth division
was to act as the reserve.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In half an hour from the time of leaving camp the
signal-station was in the hands of the Americans, and
the heliograph outfit lost to the enemy. The boys of
’98 had suffered no loss, while eight Spaniards lay with
faces upturned to the rays of the burning sun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At noon the Spanish camp had been taken, with a
loss of two Cubans killed, one American and four
Cubans wounded. Twenty-three Spaniards were dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The water-tank was destroyed, and the enemy, panic-stricken,
was fleeing here and there, yet further harassed
by a heavy fire from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Dolphin</span></span>, who sent her
shells among the fugitives whenever they came in view.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the day drew near its close, and the weary but
triumphant marines returned to camp, a hundred of
the enemy lay out on the hills dead; more than twice
that number must have been wounded, and eighteen
were being brought in as prisoners.

On this night of June 14th, at the entrance to
Santiago Harbour, the dynamite cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vesuvius</span></span>—that
experimental engine of destruction—was given
a test in actual warfare, and the result is thus
graphically pictured by a correspondent of the New
York <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Herald</span></span>:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Three shells, each containing two hundred pounds
of guncotton, were fired last night from the dynamite
guns of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vesuvius</span></span> at the hill at the western entrance

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The frightful execution done by those three shots
will be historic.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Guns in that fort had not been silenced when the

of the presence of the Spanish fleet in the
harbour.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“In the intense darkness of last night the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vesuvius</span></span>
steamed into close range and let go one of her
mysterious missiles.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“There was no flash, no smoke. There was no noise
at first. The pneumatic guns on the little cruiser did
their work silently. It was only when they felt the
shock that the men on the other war-ships knew
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vesuvius</span></span> was in action.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“A few seconds after the gun was fired there was
a frightful convulsion on the land. On the hill, where
the Spanish guns had withstood the missiles of the
ordinary ships of war, tons of rock and soil leaped in
air. The land was smitten as by an earthquake.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Terrible echoes rolled around through the shaken
hills and mountains. Sampson’s ships, far out at sea,
trembled with the awful shock. Dust rose to the
clouds and hid the scene of destruction.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Then came a long silence; next another frightful
upheaval, and following it a third, so quickly that the
results of the work of the two mingled in mid-air.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Another still, and then two shots from a Spanish
battery, that, after the noise of the dynamite, sounded
like the crackle of firecrackers.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vesuvius</span></span> had tested herself. She was found
perfect as a destroyer. She proved that no fortification
can withstand her terrible missiles.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Just what damage she did I could not tell from
the sea. Whatever was within hundreds of feet of the
point of impact must have gone to destruction.”</span>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 16.</span></span> On the fifteenth of June the marines at
Guantanamo Bay were given an opportunity to rest, for
the lesson the Spaniards received on the fourteenth
had been a severe one, and the fleet off Santiago
remained inactive. It was but the lull before the
storm of iron which was rained upon the Spanish on
the sixteenth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prelude to this third bombardment of Santiago
was a second trial of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vesuvius</span></span> at midnight on the
fifteenth, when she sent three more 250-pound charges
of guncotton into the fortifications. This done, the
fleet remained like spectres, each vessel at its respective
station, until half-past three o’clock on the morning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the sixteenth, when the bluejackets were aroused
and served with coffee.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Immediately the first gray light of dawn appeared,
the ships steamed in toward the fortifications of Santiago
until within three thousand yards, and there, lying
broadside on, three cables’-lengths apart, they waited for
the day to break.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was 5.25 when the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> opened with a broadside
from her main battery, and the bombardment was
begun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All along the crescent-shaped line the big guns
roared and the smaller ones crackled and snapped, each
piece throughout the entire squadron being worked
with such energy that it was like one mighty, continuous
wave of crashing thunder, and from out this convulsion
came projectiles of enormous weight, until it seemed
as if all that line of shore must be rent and riven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not a gun was directed at El Morro, for there it was
believed the brave Hobson and his gallant comrades
were held prisoners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the signal was given for the fleet to retire, not
a man had been wounded, nor a vessel struck by the
fire from the shore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The governor of Santiago sent the following message
to Madrid relative to the bombardment:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Americans fired one thousand shots. Several
Spanish shells hit the enemy’s vessels. Our losses are
three killed and twenty wounded, including two officers.
The Spanish squadron was not damaged.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the Americans were making their presence
felt at Santiago, those who held Guantanamo Bay were
not idle. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> bombarded
the brick fort and earthworks at Caimanera, at
the terminus of the railroad leading to the city of
Guantanamo, demolishing them entirely after an hour
and a half of firing. When the Spaniards fled from
the fortifications, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Paul</span></span> shelled them until they
were hidden in the surrounding forest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An hour or more after the bombardment ceased the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead’s</span></span> steam launch began dragging the harbour
near the fort for mines. One was found and taken up,
and while it was being towed to the war-ship a party of
Spaniards on shore opened fire. The launch headed
toward shore and began banging away, but the bow
gun finally kicked overboard, carrying the gunner with
it. At this moment the enemy beat a prompt retreat;
the gunner was pulled inboard, and the bluejackets
continued their interrupted work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 17.</span></span> Next day the batteries on Hicacal Point

<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Paul</span></span> attending to the first, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> caring
for the latter, while the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Dolphin</span></span> and even the
collier <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Scindia</span></span> fired a few shots for diversion. The
task was concluded in less than half an hour, and had
no more than come to an end when a small sloop was
sighted off the entrance to the bay.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead’s</span></span> steam launch was sent in pursuit,
and an hour later returned with the prize, which proved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to be the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Chato</span></span>. Her crew of five were taken on
board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span> as prisoners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 18.</span></span> The active little steam launch made
another capture next day while cruising outside the
bay; a nameless sloop, on which were four men who
claimed to have been sent from the lighthouse at Cape
Maysi to Guantanamo City for oil. There were strong
reasons for believing this party had come to spy out
the position of the American ships, and all were transferred
to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The crew of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> had gun practice again on
this day when they shelled and destroyed a blockhouse
three miles up the bay, killing, so it was reported, no
less than twenty of the enemy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first vessel of a long-expected fleet of transports,
carrying the second detachment of General Shafter’s
army, hove in sight of Admiral Sampson’s squadron on
the evening of June 18th, and next morning at daylight
the launches of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts</span></span> reconnoitred
the shore between Cabanas, two miles off the
entrance to Santiago Harbour, and Guayaganaco, two
miles farther west, in search of a landing-place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lieutenant Harlow, in command of the expedition,
made the following report:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The expedition consisted of a steam launch from
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts</span></span>, in charge of Cadet Hart, and a
launch from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>, in charge of Cadet Powell.
I took passage on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts’</span></span> launch, leading
the way. Soundings were taken on entering the bay
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>close under the old fort, and we were preparing to circumnavigate
the bay at full speed when fire was opened
from the fort and rocks on the shore. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts’</span></span>
launch was some distance ahead and about forty
yards off the fort. There was no room to turn, and
our 1-pounder could not be brought to bear. We
backed and turned under a heavy fire.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Cadet Hart operated the gun as soon as it could be
brought to bear, sitting exposed in the bow, and working
the gun as coolly and carefully as at target
practice.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Cadet Powell had been firing since the Spaniards
opened. He was also perfectly cool. Both launches
ran out under a heavy fire of from six to eight minutes.
I estimate that there were twenty-five Spaniards on the
parapet of the old fort. The number along shore was
larger, but indefinite. The launches, as soon as it was
practicable, sheered to give the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span> the range of the
fort. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> silenced the shore fire
promptly.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I strongly commend Cadet Hart and Cadet Powell
for the cool management of the launches. One launch
was struck seven times. Nobody in either was hurt.
A bullet struck a shell at Cadet Hart’s feet between
the projectile and the powder, but failed to explode the
latter.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Coxswain O’Donnell and Seaman Bloom are commended,
as is also the coolness with which the marines
and sailors worked under the Spanish fire.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing was learned at Cabanas Bay, but at Guayaganaco
it is evident a landing is practicable for ships’
boats. The same is true of Rancho Cruz, a small bay
to the eastward. Both would be valuable with Cabanas,
but useless without it.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I am informed that to the north and westward of
Cabanas Bay there is a large clearing, with plenty
of grass and water.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I think a simultaneous landing at the three places
named would be practicable if the ships shelled the
adjacent wood. A junction would naturally follow at
the clearing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cuban scouts reported to Colonel Huntington on
Guantanamo Bay that the streets of Caimanera have
been covered with straw saturated in oil, in order that
the city may be destroyed when the Americans evince
any disposition to take possession. The Spanish gunboat
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Sandoval</span></span>, lying at one of the piers, has been loaded
with inflammables, and will be burned with the city, her
commander declaring that she shall never become an
American prize.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During this Sunday night the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vesuvius</span></span> again discharged
her dynamite guns, with the western battery
as a target, and because of the frightful report which
followed the second shot, it was believed a magazine had
been exploded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 20.</span></span> The fleet of transports arrived off Santiago
at noon on the twentieth, and hove to outside the cordon
of war-vessels. General Shafter immediately went on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>board the flag-ship, and returned to his own ship an
hour later in company with Admiral Sampson, when
the two officers sailed for Asserradero, seventeen
miles from Santiago, where General Calixto Garcia
was encamped with his army of four thousand Cubans.
Here a long conference was held with the insurgent
general, after which the two commanders returned to
the fleet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 21.</span></span> The despatch quoted below was sent by
Admiral Sampson to the Navy Department, and gives
in full the work of the day:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Landing of the army is progressing favorably at
Daiquiri. There is very little, if any, resistance. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New Orleans</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Detroit</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Castine</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wasp</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span>
shelled the vicinity before the landing. We made a
demonstration at Cabanas to engage the attention of
the enemy. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> engaged the west battery for
some hours. She had one man killed. Ten submarine
mines have been recovered from the channel of Guantanamo.
Communication by telegraph has been established
at Guantanamo.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Daiquiri was chosen as the point of debarkation by
General Shafter, and its only fortifications were a
blockhouse on a high cliff to the right of an iron pier,
together with a small fort and earthworks in the rear.
From this town extends a good road to Santiago, and
in the immediate vicinity of the port the water-supply
is plentiful.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 22.</span></span> Bombarding the coast as a cover for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>troops which were being disembarked, was the principal
work of the war-ships on the twenty-second of June,

called for from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Marblehead</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Dolphin</span></span> to
grapple for and remove the contact mines in the harbour.
It was an undertaking as perilous as anything
that had yet been accomplished, but the bluejackets
showed no fear. Four times the designated number
came forward in response to the call, and before nightfall
seven mines had been removed.

the works of which were to be bombarded as a
portion of the general programme for this day while the
troops were being landed. The men of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> performed
their part well; the Socapa battery was quickly
silenced; but not quite soon enough to save the life of
one brave bluejacket. The last shell fired by the
retreating Spaniards struck the battle-ship twenty feet
abaft the stem on the port side. It passed through the
hull about three feet below the main-deck line, and
failed to explode until striking an iron stanchion at the
centre line of the berth-deck. Here were two guns’
crews, and among them the fragments of the shell flew
in a deadly shower, killing one and wounding eight.
Later in the day the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> steamed out to sea to bury

The boys of ’98 occupied the town of Aguadores
before nightfall on the twenty-third of June, the Spaniards
having applied the torch to many buildings before
they fled. The enemy was driven back on to Santiago,
General Linares commanding in person, and
close to his heels hung General Lawton and the
advance of the American forces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 24.</span></span> It was evident that the Spanish intended
to make a stand at Sevilla, six miles from Juragua, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>five miles from Santiago. The Americans were pressing
them hotly to prevent General Linares from gaining
time to make preparations for an encounter, when the
Rough Riders, as Colonel Wood’s regiment was termed,
and the First and Tenth Cavalry fell into an ambuscade.
Then what will probably be known as the battle of
La Quasina was fought.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is thus described by a correspondent of the
Associated Press:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the Spaniards were thoroughly posted as to
the route to be taken by the Americans in their movement
toward Sevilla was evident, as shown by the
careful preparations they had made.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The main body of the Spaniards was posted on a
hill, on the heavily wooded slopes of which had been
erected two blockhouses flanked by irregular intrenchments
of stone and fallen trees. At the bottom of
these hills run two roads, along which Lieutenant-Colonel
Roosevelt’s men, and eight troops of the First
and Tenth Cavalry, with a battery of four howitzers,
advanced. These roads are but little more than gullies,
rough and narrow, and at places almost impassable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these trails the fight occurred. Nearly half a
mile separated Roosevelt’s men from the regulars,
and between, and on both sides of the road in the
thick underbrush, was concealed a force of Spaniards
that must have been large, judging from the terrific
and constant fire they poured in on the Americans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fight was opened by the First and Tenth Cavalry,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>under General Young. A force of Spaniards was known
to be in the vicinity of La Quasina, and early in the
morning Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt’s men started off
up the precipitous bluff, back of Siboney, to attack
the enemy on his right flank. General Young at the
same time took the road at the foot of the hill.
</p>
    <a name="ill39" id="ill39" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p><div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 100%; text-align: center"><img src="images/ill39.jpg" alt="COLONEL THEODORE ROOSEVELT." title="COLONEL THEODORE ROOSEVELT." /><div class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-top: 0.75em"><span style="font-size: 75%">COLONEL THEODORE ROOSEVELT.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About two and one-half miles out from Siboney
some Cubans, breathless and excited, rushed into camp
with the announcement that the Spaniards were but a
little way in front, and were strongly entrenched.
Quickly the Hotchkiss guns in the front were brought
to the rear, while a strong scouting line was thrown
out.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then cautiously and in silence the troops moved forward
until a bend in the road disclosed a hill where the
Spaniards were located. The guns were again brought
to the front and placed in position, while the men
crouched down in the road, waiting impatiently to give
Roosevelt’s men, who were toiling over the little trail
along the crest of the hill, time to get up.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At 7.30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span> General Young gave the command to
the men at the Hotchkiss guns to open fire. That
command was the signal for a fight that for stubbornness
has seldom been equalled. The instant the
Hotchkiss guns were fired, from the hillside commanding
the road came volley after volley from the Mausers
of the Spaniards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t shoot until you see something to shoot at,”</span>
yelled General Young, and the men, with set jaws and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gleaming eyes, obeyed the order. Crawling along the
edge of the road, they protected themselves as much as
possible from the fearful fire of the Spaniards, the
troopers, some of them stripped to the waist, watching
the base of the hill, and when any part of a Spaniard
became visible, they fired. Never for an instant did
they falter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One dusky warrior of the Tenth Cavalry, with a
ragged wound in his thigh, coolly knelt behind a rock,
loading and firing, and when told by one of his comrades
that he was wounded, laughed and said:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, that’s all right. That’s been there for some
time.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meantime, away off to the left could be
heard the crack of the rifles of Colonel Wood’s men,
and the regular, deeper-toned volley-firing of the
Spaniards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Over there the American losses were the greatest.
Colonel Wood’s men, with an advance-guard well out
in front, and two Cuban guides before them, but apparently
with no flankers, went squarely into the trap
set for them by the Spaniards, and only the unfaltering
courage of the men in the face of a fire that would
even make a veteran quail, prevented what might easily
have been a disaster. As it was, Troop L, the advance-guard
under the unfortunate Captain Capron, was
almost surrounded, and but for the reinforcement
hurriedly sent forward every man would probably have
been killed or wounded.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the reserves came up there was no hesitation.
Colonel Wood, with the right wing, charged straight at
a blockhouse eight hundred yards away, and Colonel
Roosevelt, on the left, charged at the same time. Up
the men went, yelling like fiends, and never stopping to
return the fire of the Spaniards, but keeping on with
a grim determination to capture that blockhouse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That charge was the end. When within five hundred
yards of the coveted point, the Spaniards broke and
ran, and for the first time the boys of ’98 had the
pleasure which the Spaniards had been experiencing all
through the engagement, of shooting with the enemy
in sight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The losses among the Rough Riders were reported
as thirteen killed and forty wounded; while the First
Cavalry lost sixteen wounded. Edward Marshall, a
newspaper correspondent, was seriously wounded.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the land-forces were fighting four miles northwest
of Juragua, Rear-Admiral Sampson learned that
the Spaniards were endeavouring to destroy the railroad
leading from Juragua to Santiago de Cuba.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This road runs west along the seashore, under cover
of the guns of the American fleet, until within three
miles of El Morro, and then cuts through the mountains
along the river into Santiago.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the attempt of the Spaniards was discovered,
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Scorpion</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Wasp</span></span> closed in and cleared
the hill and brush of Spaniards.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 26.</span></span> The American lines were advanced to
within four miles of Santiago, and the boys could look
into the doomed city. It was possible to make accurate
note of the defences, and most likely officers as well as
men were astonished by the preparations which had
been made.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were blockhouses on every hill; from the harbour
batteries, sweeping in a semicircle to the eastward
of the city, were rifle-pits and intrenchments skilfully
arranged. Earthworks, in a regular line, completely
shut off approach to the city, and in front of the
entrenchments and rifle-pits were barbed-wire fences,
or trochas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three more charges of guncotton did the dynamite
cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vesuvius</span></span> throw into the batteries at the
mouth of Santiago Harbour on the night of June
26th, and next morning the evidences of her work
could be seen on the western battery, a portion of
which was in ruins. The water-mains which supplied
the city of Santiago were cut on the same night, and
the doomed city thus brought so much nearer to
capitulation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 1.</span></span> Knowing that with the close of June the
American army was in readiness for a decisive action,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
General W. R. Shafter, in his official
report of the operations around Santiago, says:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“On June 30th I reconnoitred the country about
Santiago and made my plan of attack. From a high
hill, from which the city was in plain view, I could see
the San Juan Hill and the country about El Caney.
The roads were very poor and, indeed, little better than
bridle-paths until the San Juan River and El Caney
were reached. The position of El Caney, to the
northeast of Santiago, was of great importance to
the enemy, as holding the Guantanamo road, as well
as furnishing shelter for a strong outpost that might
be used to assail the right flank of any force operating
against San Juan Hill. In view of this, I decided
to begin the attack next day at El Caney with one
division, while sending two divisions on the direct
road to Santiago, passing by the El Pozo house, and
as a diversion to direct a small force against Aguadores,
from Siboney along the railroad by the sea, with
a view of attracting the attention of the Spaniards
in the latter direction, and of preventing them from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>attacking our left flank.... But we were in a sickly
climate; our supplies had to be brought forward by a
narrow wagon-road which the rain might at any time
render impassable; fear was entertained that a storm
might drive the vessels containing our stores to sea,
thus separating us from our base of supplies, and,
lastly, it was reported that General Pando, with eight
thousand reinforcements for the enemy, was en route
for Manzanillo, and might be expected in a few days.
Under these conditions I determined to give battle
without delay.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Early on the morning of July 1st Lawton was in
position around El Caney, Chaffee’s brigade on the
right across the Guantanamo road, Miles’s brigade in
the centre and Ludlow’s on the left. The duty of
cutting off the enemy’s retreat along the Santiago
road was assigned to the latter brigade. The artillery
opened on the town at 6.15 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span> The battle here soon
became general, and was hotly contested. The enemy’s
position was naturally strong, and was rendered more
so by blockhouses, a stone fort and entrenchments cut
in solid rock, and the loopholing of a solidly built
stone church. The opposition offered by the enemy
was greater than had been anticipated, and prevented
Lawton from joining the right of the main line during
the day, as had been intended. After the battle had
continued for some time, Bates’s brigade of two regiments
reached my headquarters from Siboney. I directed
him to move near El Caney, to give assistance if
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>necessary. He did so, and was put in position between
Miles and Chaffee. The battle continued with varying
intensity during most of the day and until the place
was carried by assault about 4.30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P. M.</span></span> As the Spaniards
endeavoured to retreat along the Santiago road,
Ludlow’s position enabled him to do very effective
work, and practically to cut off all retreat in that direction.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“After the battle at El Caney was well opened, and
the sound of the small-arms fire caused us to believe
that Lawton was driving the enemy before him, I directed
Grimes’s battery to open fire from the heights of
El Pozo on the San Juan blockhouse, situated in the
enemy’s entrenchments, extending along the crest of
San Juan Hill. This fire was effective, and the enemy
could be seen running away from the vicinity of the
blockhouse. The artillery fire from El Pozo was soon
returned by the enemy’s artillery. They evidently had
the range of this hill, and their first shells killed and
wounded several men. As the Spaniards used smokeless
powder, it was very difficult to locate the position
of their pieces, while, on the contrary, the smoke caused
by our black powder plainly indicated the position of
our battery.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“At this time the cavalry division, under General
Sumner, which was lying concealed in the general
vicinity of the El Pozo house, was ordered forward
with directions to cross the San Juan River and deploy
to the right on the Santiago side, while Kent’s division
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was to follow closely in its rear and deploy to the left.
These troops moved forward in compliance with orders,
but the road was so narrow as to render it impracticable
to retain the column of fours formation at all points,
while the undergrowth on both sides was so dense as
to preclude the possibility of deploying skirmishers.
It naturally resulted that the progress made was slow,
and the long-range rifles of the enemy’s infantry killed
and wounded a number of our men while marching
along this road, and before there was any opportunity
to return this fire. At this time Generals Kent and
Sumner were ordered to push forward with all possible
haste, and place their troops in position to engage the
enemy. General Kent, with this end in view, forced
the head of his column alongside the cavalry column
as far as the narrow trail permitted, and thus hurried
his arrival at the San Juan, and the formation beyond
that stream. A few hundred yards before reaching the
San Juan, the road forks, a fact that was discovered
by Lieutenant-Colonel Derby of my staff, who had
approached well to the front in a war balloon. This
information he furnished to the troops, resulting in
Sumner moving on the right-hand road while Kent was
enabled to utilise the road to the left. General
Wheeler, the permanent commander of the cavalry
division, who had been ill, came forward during the
morning, and later returned to duty and rendered most
gallant and efficient service during the remainder of the
day. After crossing the stream the cavalry moved to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the right, with a view to connecting with Lawton’s left
when he would come up, with their left resting near
the Santiago road.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“In the meantime, Kent’s division, with the exception
of two regiments of Hawkins’s brigade, being thus
uncovered, moved rapidly to the front from the forks
previously mentioned in the road, utilising both trails,
but more especially the one to the left, and, crossing
the creek, formed for attack in the front of San Juan
Hill. During this formation the Third Brigade suffered
severely. While personally superintending this movement
its gallant commander, Colonel Wikoff, was
killed. The command of the brigade then devolved
upon Lieutenant-Colonel Worth, Thirteenth Infantry,
who was soon severely wounded, and next upon Lieutenant-Colonel
Liscum, Twenty-fourth Infantry, who,
five minutes later, also fell under the terrible fire
of the enemy, and the command of the brigade then
devolved upon Lieutenant-Colonel Ewers of the Ninth
Infantry.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“While the formation just described was taking place,
General Kent took measures to hurry forward his rear
brigade. The Tenth and Second Infantry were ordered
to follow Wikoff’s brigade, while the Twenty-first was
sent on the right-hand road to support the First Brigade
under General Hawkins, who had crossed the stream
and formed on the right of the division. The Second
and Tenth Infantry, Colonel E. P. Pearson commanding,
moved forward in good order on the left of the division,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>passing over a green knoll, and drove the enemy back
toward his trenches.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“After completing their formation under a destructive
fire, advancing a short distance, both divisions found in
their front a wide bottom, in which had been placed a
barbed-wire entanglement, and beyond which there was
a high hill, along the crest of which the enemy was
strongly posted. Nothing daunted, these gallant men
pushed on to drive the enemy from his chosen position,
both divisions losing heavily. In this assault Colonel
Hamilton, Lieutenants Smith and Shipp were killed,
and Colonel Carroll, Lieutenants Thayer and Myer, all
in the cavalry, were wounded. Great credit is due to
Brigadier-General H. S. Hawkins, who, placing himself
between his regiments, urged them on by voice and
bugle-call to the attack so brilliantly executed.</span>
</p>

An account of any engagement is made more vivid by
a recital of those who participated in the bloody work,
since the commanding officer views the action as a
whole, and purely from a military standpoint, while the
private, who may know little or nothing regarding the
general outcome, understands full well what took place
immediately around him. Mr. W. K. Hearst, the
pro<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prietor of the New York <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal</span></span>, told the following
graphic story in the columns of his paper:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I set out before daybreak this morning on horseback
with Honore Laine, who is a colonel in the Cuban army.
We rode over eight miles of difficult country which
intervenes between the army base, on the coast, and
the fighting line, which is being driven forward toward
Santiago.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Pozo, as a position for our battery, was ill chosen.
The Spaniards had formerly occupied it as a fort, and
they knew precisely the distance to it from their guns,
and so began their fight with the advantage of a perfect
knowledge of the range.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Their first shell spattered shrapnel in a very unpleasant
way all over the tiled roof of the white house at the
back of the ridge. It was the doors of this house which
we were approaching for shelter, and later, when we
came to take our luncheon, we found that a shrapnel
ball had passed clean through one of our cans of pressed
beef which our pack-mule was carrying.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“We turned here to the right toward our battery on
the ridge. When we were half-way between the white
house and the battery, the second shell which the
Spaniards fired burst above the American battery, not
ten feet over the heads of our men. Six of our fellows
were killed, and sixteen wounded.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The men in the battery wavered for a minute; then
rallied and returned to their guns, and the firing went
on. We passed from there to the right again, where
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>General Shafter’s war balloon was ascending. Six
shells fell in this vicinity, and then our batteries ceased
firing.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The smoke clouds from our guns were forming
altogether too plain a target for the Spaniards. There
was no trace to be seen of the enemy’s batteries, by
reason of their use of smokeless powder.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Off to the far right of our line of formation, Captain
Capron’s artillery, which had come through from
Daiquiri without rest, could be heard banging away at
Caney. We had started with a view of getting where
we could observe artillery operations, so we directed
our force thither.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“We found Captain Capron blazing away with four
guns, where he should have had a dozen. He had begun
shelling Caney at four o’clock in the morning. It
was now noon, and he was still firing. He was aiming
to reduce the large stone fort which stood on the hill
above the town and commanded it. Captain O’Connell
had laid a wager that the first shot of some one of the
four guns would hit the fort, and he had won his bet.
Since that time dozens of shells had struck the fort,
but it was not yet reduced. It had been much weakened,
however.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Through glasses our infantry could be seen advancing
toward this fort. As the cannon at our side would
bang, and the shell would swish through the air with its
querulous, vicious, whining note, we would watch its
explosion, and then turn our attention to the little black
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>specks of infantry dodging in and out among the
groups of trees. Now they would disappear wholly
from sight in the brush, and again would be seen hurrying
along the open spaces, over the grass-covered
slopes, or across ploughed fields. The infantry firing
was ceaseless, our men popping away continuously, as
a string of firecrackers pops.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The Spaniards fired in volleys against our men.
Many times we heard the volley fire, and saw the brave
fellows pitch forward and lie still on the turf, while the
others hurried on to the next protecting clump of
bushes.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“For hours the Spaniards had poured their fire from
slits in the stone fort, from their deep trenches, and
from the windows of the town. For hours our men
answered back from trees and brush and gullies. For
hours cannon at our side banged and shells screamed
through air and fell upon fort and town. Always our
infantry advanced, drawing nearer and closing up on
the village, till at last they formed under a group of
mangrove-trees at the foot of the very hill on which
the stone fort stood.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“With a rush they swept up the slope and the stone
fort was ours. Then you should have heard the yells
that went up from the knoll on which our battery stood.
Gunners, drivers, Cubans, correspondents, swung their
hats and gave a mighty cheer. Immediately our battery
stopped firing for fear we should hurt our own
men, and, dashing down into the valley, hurried across
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to take up a position near the infantry, who were now
firing on Caney from the blockhouse. The town artillery
had not sent half a dozen shots from its new
position before the musketry firing ceased, and the
Spaniards, broken into small bunches, fled from Caney
in the direction of Santiago.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Laine and I hurried up to the stone fort and found
that James Creelman, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal</span></span> correspondent with the
infantry column, had been seriously wounded and was
lying in the Twelfth Infantry hospital. Our men were
still firing an occasional shot, and from blockhouses
and isolated trenches, from which the Spaniards could
not safely retreat, flags of truce were waving.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Guns and side-arms were being taken away from
such Spaniards as had outlived the pitiless fire, and
their dead were being dumped without ceremony into
the trenches, after the Spanish fashion.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“When I left the fort to hunt for Creelman, I found
him, bloody and bandaged, lying on his back on a
blanket on the ground, but shown all care and attention
that kindly and skilful surgeons could give him. His
first words to me were that he was afraid he could not
write much of a story, as he was pretty well dazed, but
if I would write for him he would dictate the best he
could. I sat down among the wounded, and Creelman
told me his story of the fight. Here it is:</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘The extraordinary thing in this fight of all the

the extreme right, with Ludlow down in the low country
to the left of Caney. General Chaffee’s brigade
consisted of the Seventeenth, Seventh, and Twelfth

on the northwest corner of Caney, where the principal
Spanish force lay, with their hats on sticks to deceive
our riflemen. From this position the enemy poured in
a fearful fire. The Seventeenth had to lie down flat
under the pounding, but even then men were killed.</span></span>

back of his head like a magnificent cowboy, urging his
men on, crying to them to get in and help their country

comes from. When you stand up to see you get a
bullet.</span></span>

Before five o’clock, on the morning of July 2d, the
crew of the flag-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> was astir, eating a
hurried breakfast.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At 5.50 general quarters was sounded, and the flag-ship
headed in toward Aguadores, about three miles
east of Morro Castle. The other ships retained their
blockading stations. Along the surf-beaten shore the
smoke of an approaching train from Altares was seen.
It was composed of open cars full of General Duffield’s
troops.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At a cutting a mile east of Aguadores the train
stopped, and the Cuban scouts proceeded along the
railroad track. The troops got out of the cars, and
soon formed in a long, thin line, standing out vividly
against the yellow rocks that rose perpendicularly
above, shutting them off from the main body of the
army, which was on the other side of the hill, several
miles north.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the quarter of the flag-ship there was a signal,
by a vigorously wigwagged letter, and a few minutes
later, from a clump of green at the water’s edge, came
an answer from the army. This was the first coöperation
for offensive purposes between the army and navy.

made by Rear-Admiral Sampson to the army.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“General Duffield is ahead with the scouts,”</span> came
the answer from the shore to the flag-ship.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> was in company with the flag-ship,

the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Newark</span></span> came up and took a position to the westward.
Her decks were black with fifteen hundred or
more troops.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She went alongside of the flag-ship, and was told to
disembark the troops at Altares.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then Admiral Sampson signalled to General Duffield:

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By 9.30 the last of the soldiers had left the open
railroad tracks, disappearing in the thick brush that
covered the eastern side of Aguadores inlet.

The water in the sponge tubes under the breeches of
the big guns was growing hot in the burning sun.

Ashore there was no sign of the Spaniards. They
were believed to be on the western bluff.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Between the bluffs ran a rocky gully, leading into
Santiago City. On the extremity of the western arm
was an old castellated fort, from which the Spanish flag
was flying, and on the parapet on the eastern hill, commanding
the gully, two stretches of red earth could
easily be seen against the brush. These were the
rifle-pits.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At 10.15 a signal-flag ashore wigwagged to Admiral
Sampson to commence firing, and a minute later the

the old fort.

Of our troops ashore in the brush nothing could be
seen, but the ping, ping, of the small arms of the army
floated out to sea during the occasional lull in the
firing of the big guns, which peppered the rifle-pits
until clouds of red earth rose above them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An 8-inch shell from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Newark</span></span> dropped in the
massive old fort, and clouds of white dust and huge
stones filled the air. When the small shells hit its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>battlements, almost hidden by green creepers, fragments
of masonry came tumbling down. A shot from
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> hit the eastern parapet, and it crumbled
away. Amid the smoke and débris, the flagstaff was
seen to fall forward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The flag has been shot down!”</span> shouted the ship’s
crew, but, when the smoke cleared away, the emblem
of Spain was seen to be still flying and blazing brilliantly
in the sun, though the flagstaff was bending
toward the earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few more shots from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> levelled the
battlements until the old castle was a pitiful sight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the firing ceased, Lieutenant Delehanty of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> was anxious to finish his work, so he signalled
to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>, asking permission to knock down the
Spanish flag.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> replied Admiral Sampson, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you can do it
in three shots.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> then lay about sixteen hundred yards
from the old fort. She took her time. Lieutenant
Blue carefully aimed the 4-inch gun, and the crews of all
the ships watched the incident amid intense excitement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the smoke of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee’s</span></span> first shot cleared
away, only two red streamers of the flag were left. The
shell had gone through the centre of the bunting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A delighted yell broke from the crew of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two or three minutes later the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> fired again,
and a huge cloud of débris rose from the base of the
flagstaff.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For a few seconds it was impossible to tell what had
been the effect of the shot. Then it was seen that the
shell had only added to the ruin of the fort.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The flagstaff seemed to have a charmed existence,
and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> only had one charge left. It seemed
hardly possible for her to achieve her object with the
big gun, such a distance, and such a tiny target.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was breathless silence among the watching
crews. They crowded on the ships’ decks, and all eyes
were on that tattered flag, bending toward the top of
what had once been a grand old castle. But it was
only bending, not yet down. Lieutenant-Commander
Delehanty and Lieutenant Blue took their time. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> changed her position slightly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then a puff of smoke shot out from her side, up
went a shooting cloud of débris from the parapet, and
down fell the banner of Spain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such yells from the flag-ship will probably never be
heard again. There was more excitement than witnessed
at the finish of a college boat-race, or a popular
race between first-class thoroughbreds on some big
track.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee’s</span></span> last shot had struck right at the
base of the flagstaff, and had blown it clear of the
wreckage, which had held it from finishing its fall.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well done!”</span> signalled Admiral Sampson to Lieutenant-Commander
Delehanty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At 11.30 General Duffield signalled that his scouts
reported that no damage had been done to the Spanish
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rifle-pits by the shells from the ships, and Admiral
Sampson told him they had been hit several times, but
that there was no one in the pits. However, the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Suwanee</span></span> was ordered to fire a few more shots in their
direction.

At 12.18 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P. M.</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> having discontinued
fire at Aguadores, commenced firing 8-inch shells
clear over the gully into the city of Santiago de Cuba.
Every five minutes the shells went roaring over the
hillside. What destruction they wrought it was impossible
to tell, as the smoke hid everything. In reply
to General Duffield’s question:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What is the news?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Admiral Sampson replied:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There is not a Spaniard left in the rifle-pits.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Later General Duffield signalled that his scouts
thought reinforcements were marching to the battered
old fort, and Admiral Sampson wigwagged him:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There is no Spaniard left there. If any come the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> will take care of them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A little later the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> joined the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> intending
8-inch shells into the city of Santiago. This
was kept up until 1.40 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P. M.</span></span> By that time General
Duffield had sent a message saying that his troops
could not cross the stream, but would return to Altares.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the report that some Spanish troops were still
in the gully, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> shelled it
once more, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Newark</span></span>, which had not fired,
signalled:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Can I fire for target practice? Have had no
previous opportunity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Permission for her to do so was signalled, and she
blazed away, shooting well, her 6-inch shells exploding
with remarkable force among the rocks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At 2.40 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P. M.</span></span> Admiral Sampson hoisted the signal to
cease firing, and the flag-ship returned to the blockading
station.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the railroad a train-load of troops had already left
for Altares.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. A. Maurice Low, of the Boston <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Globe</span></span>, thus relates
his personal experience:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“When the fighting ceased on Friday evening, July
1st, every man was physically spent, and needed food
and rest more than anything else. For a majority of
the troops there was a chance to cook bacon and make
coffee; for the men of the hospital corps, the work of
the day was commencing. At convenient points hospitals
were established, and men from every company
were sent out to search the battle-ground for the dead
and wounded.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It is the men of the hospital corps who have the
ghastly side of war. There is never any popular glory
for them; there is no passion of excitement to sustain
them. The emotion of battle keeps a man up under
fire. Something in the air makes even a coward brave.
But all that is wanting when the surgeons go into
action.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Men come staggering into the hospital with blood
dripping from their wounds; squads of four follow one
another rapidly, bearing stretchers and blankets, on
which are limp, motionless, groaning forms.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“To those of us at home who are in the habit of
seeing our sick and injured treated with the utmost
consideration and delicacy, who see the poor and outcast
and criminal put into clean beds and surrounded
with luxuries, the way in which the wounded on a
battle-field are disposed of seems barbarous in the
extreme. Of course it is unavoidable, but it is nevertheless
horrible.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“As soon as men were brought in they were at once
taken off the litters and placed on the bare ground.
Time was too precious, and there were too many men
needing attention for a soldier to monopolise a stretcher
until the surgeon could reach him.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“There was no shelter. The men lay on the bare
ground with the sun streaming down on them, many
of them suffering the greatest agony, and yet very few
giving utterance to a groan. Where I watched operations
for a time there was only one surgeon, who took
every man in his turn, and necessarily had to make
many of them wait a long time.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“And yet these men were much more fortunate than
many others, some of whom lay on the battle-field for
twenty-four hours before they were found. There was
no chloroform; very little of anything to numb pain.
Painful gunshot wounds were dressed hastily, almost
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>roughly, until ambulances could be sent out to take
the men to the divisional hospitals in the rear.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It is claimed that the hospital arrangements were
inadequate, and that many regiments went into action
without a surgeon. From what I saw I think the
criticism to be justified. Naturally the wounded were
taken care of first,—the last duties to the dead could
be performed later.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It was ghastly as one moved over the battle-field to
come across an upturned face lying in a pool of blood,
to see what was once a man, bent, and twisted, and
doubled. And still more horrible was it as the moonlight
fell over the field, and at unexpected places one
ran against this fruit of war and saw faces in the pallor
of death made even more ghostlike by the light, while
the inevitable sea of crimson stood out in more startling
vividness by the contrast.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“We had won the battle, but our position was a
somewhat precarious one.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Our line was long and thin, and there was a danger
of the Spaniards breaking through and attacking us in
the rear or left flank. To guard against this possibility,
Lawton’s division at El Caney was ordered to move on
to El Pozo, and Kent’s division was under orders to
draw in its left. The men who had fought at El Caney
were hoping to be allowed to sleep on the battle-field
and obtain the rest which they so badly needed, but
after supper they were placed under arms and the
march commenced.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The Seventh U. S. Infantry led. It was a weird
march. Immediately after leaving El Caney we crossed
an open field, a skirmish line was thrown out, and the
men were commanded to maintain absolute silence.
We were in the heart of the enemy’s country, and
caution was necessary.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“After crossing this field we came to a deep gully
through which ran a swift stream almost knee-deep.
Our way led across this stream, and there was only
one means of getting over. That was to plunge in
and splash through. Tired as we all were, after getting
thoroughly wet our feet felt like lead, and marching
was perfect torture. Still there was no let-up.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“We pressed steadily forward until we came to where
the road forked off. Our directions had not been very
explicit, we had no maps, and our commander took the
road which he thought was the right one. It soon led
between high banks of dense growth of chaparral on
either side. The moon had disappeared behind the
clouds, and had the Spaniards wanted to ambuscade
us we were at their mercy.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not say that we were nervous, exactly, but I
think we would all rather have been out of that lane.
The fear that your enemy may be crouching behind
bushes, that you know nothing of his presence until
he pours a rifle fire into you, is rather trying on the
nerves.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The command was frequently halted for the officers
to consult, and after we had gone about a mile they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>concluded they were on the wrong road, and went to
the right about. When we came out where we had
started we found Brigadier-General Chaffee sitting
silent on a big horse and watching a seemingly never-ending
line of men marching past him. We fell into
position and pushed on the road to Santiago.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“How long we marched that night I cannot tell. It
seemed interminable. My watch had run down and no
one around me had the time. Finally we were ordered
to halt, and the men were told to stack arms, take off
their packs, and rest.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I dropped my blanket roll, which seemed to me
weighed not less than two hundred pounds, on the
muddy road, and sat down to rest. The next thing
I knew some one tapped me on the shoulder. It was
three o’clock, and I had been asleep for some hours.
The regiment was again under arms, and was receiving
ammunition from a pack-train which had come up from
the rear. We pressed on until early dawn, when we
were well in front of Santiago. Entrenchments were
hastily thrown up, and we were ready for the enemy.
The enemy did not give us much time for rest. They
made an assault upon our position early in the morning,
which we repulsed....</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“While the Spaniards were unable to dislodge us,
they succeeded in forcing our artillery back, which had
taken a position that subjected it to a withering infantry
fire. Later in the day this position was recovered and
entrenchments thrown up, which, it was claimed, made
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the position impregnable. The guns were so placed
they could do tremendous destruction.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There was a lull that afternoon, but in the evening
the Spaniards opened up an attack along our entire line,
with the intention, evidently, of taking us by surprise and
rushing us out of our entrenchments. But their purpose
was a failure.”</span>
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
General Lawton, in his report after the assault upon
and the capture of El Caney by his division during the
first day’s fighting, says:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It may not be out of place to call attention to this
peculiar phase of the battle.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It was fought against an enemy fortified and entrenched
within a compact town of stone and concrete
houses, some with walls several feet thick, and supported
by a number of covered solid stone forts, and
the enemy continued to resist until nearly every man
was killed or wounded, with a seemingly desperate
resolution.”</span>

It was Sergeant McKinnery, of Company B, Ninth
Infantry, who shot and disabled General Linares, the
commander of the Spanish forces in Santiago. The
Spanish general was hit about an hour after San Juan
Hill was taken, during the first day’s fighting. The
American saw a Spaniard, evidently a general officer,
followed by his staff, riding frantically about the Spanish
position, rallying his men.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sergeant McKinnery asked Lieutenant Wiser’s permission
to try a shot at the officer, and greatly regretted
to find the request refused. Major Bole was consulted.
He acquiesced, with the injunction that no one else
should fire. Sergeant McKinnery slipped a shell into
his rifle, adjusted the sights for one thousand yards,
and fired. The shell fell short. Then he put in
another, raised the sights for another one thousand
yards, took careful aim, and let her go. The officer on
the white horse threw up his arms and fell forward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That is for Corporal Joyce,”</span> said McKinnery as he
saw that his ball had reached the mark. The officer on
the white horse was General Linares himself. It was
afterward learned that he was shot in the left shoulder.
He immediately relinquished the command to General
Toral.

It was Sunday morning (July 3d), and the American
squadron lay off Santiago Harbour intent only on
blockade duty. No signs of life were visible about old
Morro. Beyond and toward the city all was still. After
two days of fighting the armies of both nations were
resting in their trenches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fleet had drifted three miles or more from the
land. The battle-ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts</span></span>, the protected
cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New Orleans</span></span>, and Commodore Watson’s flag-ship,
the cruiser <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Newark</span></span>, were absent, coaling fifty
miles or more away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shortly before nine o’clock Admiral Sampson, desiring
to ascertain the exact condition of the Spanish
coast defences about Aguadores, ordered the flag-ship
to go that way, and after flying the signal, <span class="tei tei-q">“Disregard
the motions of the commander-in-chief,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>
steamed leisurely off to the eastward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The little <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> lay nearest the shore; the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span>
was opposite in a straight line, and to the eastward of
her about five miles. A mile or less from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the seaward, was the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span>. Nearly as far from
the latter ship, and southeast of her, lay the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span>.
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> was the outermost ship of the fleet, lying
four miles from the harbour entrance; next her, to the
eastward, each vessel slightly nearer inshore, were the
    <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> in the order named.

Shoreward, inside the harbour, could be seen a long
line of black smoke. On board the fleet religious
services were being held, but the lookouts of every
ship were at their stations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suddenly, at about half past nine, a dark hull was
seen coming out past the point of the harbour, and
instantly all was seemingly confusion on the big fighting
machines.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The enemy is escaping,”</span> was the signal run up on
Commodore Schley’s flag-ship, and within a few seconds
the roar of a 6-pounder on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> broke the stillness
of the Sabbath morning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was as if every American vessel was put in motion
at the same instant, and even as the flag-ship’s signal
appeared, the clouds of dense smoke from their stacks
told that the men in the furnace-rooms had already
begun their portion of the task so unexpectedly set for
all the fleet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John R. Spear, author of <span class="tei tei-q">“The History of our
Navy,”</span> who was with Sampson’s fleet, wrote this complete
story of the marvellous naval battle off Santiago
and along the southern shore of Cuba, for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">World</span></span>:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The enemy was first seen at 9.30, and at 9.32 the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>men of the American batteries were standing erect
and silent beside their loaded guns, waiting for the
order to commence firing, and watching out of the
corners of their eyes the boys who were still sprinkling
the decks with sand that no one’s foot might slip when
blood began to flow across the planks.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“But though silence prevailed among the guns, down
in the sealed stoke-hole the click and ring of the shovels
that sprayed the coal over the glowing grate-bars, the
song of the fans that raised the air pressure, and
the throb of pump and engine made music for the
whole crew, for the steam-gauges were climbing, and
the engineers were standing by the wide-open throttles
as the ships were driven straight at the enemy.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“For, as it happened, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> had been lying directly
off the harbour, and a little more than two miles
away the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> was but a few lengths farther out and to
the westward, while Capt. Jack Philip of the one, and
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Fighting Bob’</span> Evans of the other, were both on
deck when the cry was raised announcing the enemy.
Hastening to their bridges, they headed away at once
for the Spaniards, while the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>
went flying to westward to intercept the leader.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The mightiest race known to the history of the
world, and the most thrilling, was begun.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“They were all away in less time than it has taken the
reader to get thus far in the story, and in much less
time still,—indeed, before the gongs in the engine-rooms
of the Yankee ships had ceased to vibrate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>under the imperative order of <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ahead, full speed!’</span>—the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Almirante Oquendo</span></span>, fugitive as she was, had
opened the battle. With impetuous haste, and while yet
more than two miles away, the Spaniard pointed one of
his long 11-inch hontoria rifles in the direction of
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> and pulled the lanyard. The shell came
shrieking out to sea, but to sea only.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“Instantly the great guns of the Morro, 180 feet
above the water, and those of the Socapa battery,
lying higher still, with all the batteries beneath those
two, began to belch and roar as their crews strove with
frantic energy to aid the flying squadron.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, it was about three minutes from the appearance
of the first Spaniard to the firing of the first American
gun.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“In these three minutes the distance between the
squadrons was lessened by at least a mile,—the range
was not more than two thousand yards.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“But while two thousand yards is the range (about
one and one-sixth miles) selected for great gun target
practice, it will never do for an eager fight, and as the
trend of the land still headed the Spanish off to southward,
the battle-ships were able to reduce the range to
fifteen hundred yards before they were obliged to head
a course parallel with the Spaniards.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Meantime the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>, as they were
stretching away toward the coast, had opened fire also,
and then the last of the big Spaniards, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta
Maria Teresa</span></span>, having rounded the point, the
    magnifi<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cent spectacle of a squadron battle on the open sea—of
a battle between four of the best modern armed
cruisers on the Spanish side, against three battle-ships
and an armoured cruiser on our side—was spread out
to view.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“And their best was the worst struggle the world
ever saw, for it was a struggle to get out of range
while firing with hysterical vehemence their unaimed
guns.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The first shot from the American ships fell short,
and a second, in like fashion, dropped into the sea. At
that the gunner said things to himself under his breath
(it was in the forward turret of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>), and tried it
once more.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“For a moment after it the cloud of gun smoke
shrouded the turret, but as that thinned away the eager
crew saw the 12-inch shell strike into the hull of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span>. Instantly it exploded with
tremendous effect. Flame and smoke belched from
the hole the shell had made, and puffed from port and
hatch. And then in the wake of the driven blast rolled
up a volume of flame-streaked smoke that showed the
woodwork had taken fire and was burning fiercely all
over the after part of the stricken ship.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The yell that rose from the Yankee throats at that
sight swelled to a roar of triumph a moment later, for
as he saw that smoke, the captain of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Teresa</span></span> threw
her helm over to port, and headed her for the rocky
beach. The one shell had given a mortal wound.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“And then came Wainwright of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span>,—Lieut.-Commander
Richard Wainwright, who for weeks conducted
the weary search for the dead bodies of shipmates
on the wreck in the harbour of Havana. He
was captain of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>, that was once known as
the yacht <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Corsair</span></span>. A swift and beautiful craft she, but
only armed with lean 6-pounders.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ahead, full speed,’</span> said Wainwright.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“And fortune once more favoured the brave, for in the
wake of the mighty <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maria Teresa</span></span> came Spain’s two big
torpedo-boats, called destroyers, because of their size,—the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Pluton</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Furor</span></span>. Either was more than a
match for the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>, for one carried two 12-pounders,
and the other two 14-pounders, besides the
6-pounders that both carried.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Moreover, both overmatched the speed of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> by at least ten knots per hour. But both
had thin-plated sides. The shells of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>
could pierce them, and at them went Wainwright, with
the memory of that night in Havana uppermost in his
mind.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The two boats—even the whole Spanish fleet—were
still within easy range of the Spanish forts, and to
reach his choice of enemies the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> was obliged
to risk not only the land fire, but that of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>
and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Teresa</span></span>. Nevertheless, as the torpedo-boats
steered toward the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>, evidently bound to torpedo
her, Wainwright headed them off, and they never
got beyond range of the forts.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“The shots they threw at him outweighed his three
to one, but theirs flew wild, and his struck home.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The day of the destroyers was done. As the big
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maria Teresa</span></span> turned toward the shore, these two
destroyers, like stricken wild fowl, fled fluttering and
splashing in the same direction, and they floundered as
they fled.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“While the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span> was on fire, and
running for the beach, her crew was still working their
guns, and the big <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span> was handily by to double the
storm of projectiles she was hurling at the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> and

the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> had the range, and it was only

    <span class="tei tei-q">“And then came the finishing stroke. A 12-inch
shell from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> went crashing into the stoke-hole,
and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>,—the ship whose beauty and power
once thrilled the hearts of New Yorkers with mingled
pleasure and fear—was mortally wounded. Hope

the enemy, but while her gunners were taking aim for
a final broadside a half-naked quartermaster on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>,
with clawing hands on the halliards, hauled down
the fever-hued ensign from her peak and hoisted the

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Huge volumes of black smoke, edged with red
flame, rolled from every port and shot hole of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>,
as from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Teresa</span></span>. They were both furnaces of
glowing fire. Though they had come from the harbour
to certain battle, not a wooden bulkhead, nor a partition
in the quarters either of officers or men had been
taken out, nor had trunks and chests been sent ashore.
Neither had the wooden decks nor any other wooden
fixtures been prepared to resist fire. Apparently the
crew had not even wet down the decks.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“But the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> tarried at this gruesome scene only
for a moment. They wished only to make sure that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the two Spaniards were really out of the fight, and
when they saw the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> was going to stand by both,
away they went to join the race between the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>

of the Spaniards, and in spite of the delay on the part
of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, the Spaniards were not yet wholly out of
range, though the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span> was reaching away at
a speed that gave the Spanish shore forces hope.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Under battened hatches the Yankee firemen,
stripped to their trousers, plied their shovels and
raised the steam-gauges higher. The Yankee ships
were grass-grown and barnacled, but now they were
driven as never before since their trial trips. The
Spaniards had called us pigs, but Nemesis had turned
us into spear-armed huntsmen in chase of game that
neither tusks nor legs could save.</span>

the equal at least of our own <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>, long-headed
Commodore Schley saw that she was hugging the
coast, although a point of land loomed in the distance
to cut her off or drive her out to sea.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Instead of striving to close in on the Spaniards,
Schley headed straight for that point,—took the shortest
cut for it, so to speak,—and in that way drew
steadily ahead of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Colon</span></span>, leaving to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> the task of holding the Spaniards from turning

and there was not enough armour on any Spanish ship

the Pacific was driving into her with unerring aim.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“At ten o’clock sharp the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oquendo</span></span> was apparently
still fore and aft, but within five minutes she wavered
and lagged, and a little later, flag-ship though she was,
she put her helm to port, as her consorts had done, and
fled for life to the beach.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> was coming with unflagging speed astern,
and off to the east could be seen the flag-ship of
Admiral Sampson racing as never before to get a
shot in at the finish. An auxiliary had been sent by
Commodore Schley to call her, and it had met her
coming at the call of the guns of the Spanish fleet.
She had overhauled and passed the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span> long since,
and was well-nigh abreast of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>. So the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span>,
in order to vie with the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> in the last of the

under the impulse of a tremendous explosion on board
the doomed Spaniard, while a vast volume of smoke
filled with splintered wreck rose in the air. Had they
been near enough they would have heard the crew of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> start in to cheer, and have heard as well the voice
of Captain Philip say, as he raised his hand to check it:</span>

Spanish squadron remained, and she was now in the
last desperate struggle, the flurry of a monster of
the deep. Her officers peered with frowning brows
through gilded glasses at the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> forging ahead
far off their port bow; at the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> within range off
the port quarter; at the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> just getting the
range with her beautiful 8-inch rifles astern. They
shivered in unison with the quivering hulk as shot
after shot struck home. They screamed at their crews
and stamped and fumed. At the guns their crews
worked with drunken desperation, but down in the
stoke-hole the firemen plied their shovels with a will
and a skill that formed the most surprising feature of
the Spanish side of the battle. Because of them this
was a race worthy of the American mettle, for it put
to the full test the powers of the men of the three
ships in chase.</span>

work of destroying her, so that we should not be able

    <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> had drawn up abeam of her, and was
about a mile away. The shots from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>
astern were beginning to tell, and those from the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> had all along been smiting her in the face.</span>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to go to Siboney, whence the admiral had proposed

    <span class="tei tei-q">“When about two miles off from Altares Bay, and
about four miles east of her usual position, the Spanish
fleet was observed coming out and making westward in
the following order: <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span> (flag), <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“They were at once engaged by the ships nearest,
and the result was practically established in a very
short time. The heavy and rapid shell fire was very
destructive to both ships and men. The cruisers <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta
Maria Teresa</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Almirante Oquendo</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>
were run ashore in the order named, afire and burning
fiercely. The first ship was beached at Nima, nine and
one-half miles west of the port; the second at Juan
Gonzalez, six miles west; the third at Acerraderos,
fifteen miles. The torpedo-boat destroyers were both
sunk, one near the beach, the other in deep water about
three miles west of the harbour entrance.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“The remaining ship, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span>, stood on

half knots, but they could not keep this up, chiefly on
account of the fatigue of her men, who, many of them,
had been ashore at Santiago the day before, and had
been, while there, long without food; her average speed
was actually thirteen and seven-tenths knots, the ship
leaving the harbour at 9.43 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span>, and reaching Rio

seeing no chance of an escape from so overwhelming a
force, the heavy shells of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> already dropping
around and beyond her, she ran ashore at Rio Tarquino

were treacherously opened, and in spite of all efforts
she gradually sank, and now lies near the beach in
water of moderate depth. It is to be hoped that she
may be floated, as she was far the finest ship of the
squadron. All her breech plugs were thrown overboard
after the surrender, and the breech-blocks of her
Mauser rifles thrown away.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Just before midnight of this date the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts</span></span>,
which was in front of the port with her search-light up
to the entrance, reported an enemy’s vessel coming out,
and she and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> fired a number of shots in the
direction of the harbour mouth. The batteries also
opened, and a number of shell fell at various points, the
attention paid by the batteries to the ships being general.
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span> was struck on the starboard side of
the quarter-deck by a mortar shell, which exploded on
reaching the second deck near the ward-room ladder;
it caused a fire which was quickly extinguished. This
was the first accident of the kind to the fleet. The vessel
inside turned out to be the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Reina Mercedes</span></span>, which
was sunk on the east edge of the channel just by the
Estrella battery. She heads north, and is canted over
to port with her port rail under water. She does not
appear to obstruct the channel.”</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“Mention of the presence of the torpedo-boat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Ericsson</span></span>,
on the third instant, was unfortunately omitted.
She was in company with a flag-ship, and turned at
once upon sighting the enemy. As she was drawing
away from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> she signalled, asking permission
to continue in chase, but she was directed to pick
up two men in the water, which she did, and on reaching
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span> she was directed by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>, the
flag-ship having gone ahead, to assist in the rescue of
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya’s</span></span> crew. She took off eleven officers and
ninety men. The guns of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span> during the
    oper<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ation were going off from the heat, and explosions
were frequent, so that the work was trying and perilous
for the boats of the two vessels (<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Ericsson</span></span>)
engaged.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The former report from the army, which was official,
regarding General Pando’s entry into Santiago,
was an error. General Shafter thought that he had
been enabled to form a junction, but some few of his
men only had been able to do so; the general himself
and his remaining force, it is thought, will not be
able.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The day was an uneventful one from a naval standpoint.
The flag-ship went to the wrecks of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta
Maria Teresa</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Almirante</span></span>. The former lies in
an easy position on sand, and with almost her normal
draught of water. She is, of course, completely burned
out inside above her protective deck, but the shell of
her hull seems very good, and her machinery is probably
not seriously injured.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It looks very much as if she were salvable. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Almirante</span></span> was much worse <a name="corr270" id="corr270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">off</span>. She had been subjected
to a much heavier gun fire, being racked and
torn in every part; she is much more out of water,
and the forward part is much distorted and torn by the
explosion of her magazine and torpedoes. The loss of
life was very great. Charred bodies are strewn everywhere,
the vicinity of the port forward torpedo-room,
particularly, was almost covered. The torpedo exploded
in the tube; it may be by a shot. This is a question
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which it is hoped may be conclusively decided. The
fact of so many bodies being about would seem to bear
this out, but two of her crew, taken off the beach this
afternoon, were questioned, and both stated that it was
the result of fire, and that the number of bodies is to
be accounted for by the fact that the operating-room is
just below, and that many wounded came up that far
and were suffocated. The two men were intelligent
young fellows, and talked freely. They said that the
gun fire was such that it was impossible to keep
the men at the guns. One was a powder passer, the
other at a 57-mm gun. In the forward turret were two
officers and five men, evidently killed by the entry of a
6-pounder shell between the top of the turret and the
gun shield. Altogether the ship was a most striking
instance of what rapid and well-directed gun fire may
accomplish. She was terribly battered about.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“While the flag-ship was lying near the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Almirante</span></span>,
and her steam cutter was alongside, and a small boat
from the press tug <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hercules</span></span> lying on the starboard
quarter, a shell exploded in a 15-centimetre gun, and
a piece went through the tug’s boat, cutting it in two;
the man in the boat was not hurt. It is somewhat
extraordinary that this shell should have waited so long
to act, as the after part of the ship was generally well
cooled off. There was still much heat and some flames
about the bow. One extraordinary fact is the survival,
in proper shape, of many powder grains, baked hard;
several of these were picked up about the deck.</span>

report upon the battle with and the destruction of the
Spanish squadron, commanded by Admiral Cervera, off
Santiago de Cuba, on Sunday, July 3, 1898:</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“2. The enemy’s vessels came out of the harbour
between 9.35 and 10 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span>, the head of the column
appearing around Cay Smith at 9.31, and emerging
from the channel five or six minutes later.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“3. The positions of the vessels of my command
off Santiago at that moment were as follows: The flag-ship
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> was four miles east of her blockading
station and about seven miles from the harbour entrance.
She had started for Siboney, where I had
intended to land, accompanied by several of my staff,
and go to the front to consult with General Shafter.
A discussion of the situation, and a more definite understanding
between us of the operations proposed, had
been rendered necessary by the unexpectedly strong
resistance of the Spanish garrison at Santiago.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I had sent my chief of staff on shore the day
before to arrange an interview with General Shafter,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>who had been suffering from heat prostration. I made
arrangements to go to his headquarters, and my flag-ship
was in the position mentioned above when the
Spanish squadron appeared in the channel.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The remaining vessels were in or near their usual
blockading positions, distributed in a semicircle about
the harbour entrance, counting from the eastward to
the westward in the following order: The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span>,
about a mile and a half from shore, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span>,—the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York’s</span></span> place between these two,—the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>, the latter two miles from the shore
west of Santiago.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The distance of the vessels from the harbour
entrance was two and a half to four miles,—the latter
being the limit of day blockading distance. The length
of the arc formed by the ships was about eight miles.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts</span></span> had left at four <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span> for Guantanamo
for coal. Her station was between the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>. The auxiliaries, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span>, lay
close to the land and nearer the harbour entrance than
the large vessels, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> to the eastward and
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span> to the westward.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The torpedo-boat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Ericsson</span></span> was in company with
the flag-ship, and remained with her during the chase
until ordered to discontinue, when she rendered very
efficient service in rescuing prisoners from the burning
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>. I enclose a diagram showing approximately
the positions of the vessels as described above.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“4. The Spanish vessels came rapidly out of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>harbour, at a speed estimated at from eight to ten knots,
and in the following order: <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span> (flag-ship),
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Almirante
Oquendo</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The distance between these ships was about eight
hundred yards, which means that, from the time the
first one became visible in the upper reach of the channel
until the last one was out of the harbour, an interval
of only about twelve minutes elapsed.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Following the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oquendo</span></span>, at a distance of about
twelve hundred yards, came the torpedo-boat destroyer
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Pluton</span></span>, and after her came the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Furor</span></span>. The armoured
cruisers, as rapidly as they could bring their guns to
bear, opened a vigorous fire upon the blockading vessels,
and emerged from the channel shrouded in the
smoke from their guns.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“5. The men of our ships in front of the port were
at Sunday <span class="tei tei-q">‘quarters for inspection.’</span> The signal was
given simultaneously from several vessels, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Enemy’s
ships escaping,’</span> and general quarters were sounded.
The men cheered as they sprang to their guns, and
fire was opened, probably within eight minutes, by the
vessels whose guns commanded the entrance.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> turned about and steamed for the
escaping fleet, flying the signal, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Close in toward
harbour entrance and attack vessels,’</span> and gradually
increasing speed until toward the end of the chase she
was making sixteen and one-half knots, and was rapidly
closing on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span>.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“She was not, at any time, within the range of the
heavy Spanish ships, and her only part in the firing was
to receive the undivided fire from the forts in passing
the harbour entrance, and to fire a few shots at
one of the destroyers, thought at the moment to be
attempting to escape from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“6. The Spanish vessels, upon clearing the harbour,
turned to the westward in column, increasing their
speed to the full power of their engines. The heavy
blockading vessels, which had closed in toward the
Morro, at the instant of the enemy’s appearance, and
at their best speed, delivered a rapid fire, well sustained
and destructive, which speedily overwhelmed
and silenced the Spanish fire.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The initial speed of the Spaniards carried them
rapidly past the blockading vessels, and the battle
developed into a chase in which the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span> had at the start the advantage of position. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> maintained this lead.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span>, steaming with amazing speed from the
commencement of the action, took first place. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span> having done good work, and not
having the speed of the other ships, were directed by
me, in succession, at about the time the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span> was
beached, to drop out of the chase and resume blockading
stations. These vessels rescued many prisoners.
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span>, finding that the rush of the Spanish ships
would put her between two fires, ran outside of our own
column and remained there during the battle and chase.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“7. The skilful handling and gallant firing of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> excited the admiration of every one who
witnessed it, and merits the commendation of the Navy
Department. She is a fast and entirely unprotected
auxiliary vessel,—the yacht <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Corsair</span></span>,—and has a good
battery of light rapid-fire guns.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“She was lying about two miles from the harbour
entrance to the southward and eastward, and immediately
steamed in, opening fire upon the large
ships.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Anticipating the appearance of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Pluton</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Furor</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> was slowed, thereby gaining more
rapidly a high pressure of steam, and when the destroyers
came out she steamed for them at full speed and
was able to close at short range, where her fire was
accurate, deadly, and of great volume.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“During this fight the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> was under the fire
of the Socapa battery. Within twenty minutes from
the time they emerged from Santiago Harbour the
careers of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Furor</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Pluton</span></span> were ended, and
two-thirds of their people killed. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Furor</span></span> was
beached and sunk in the surf; the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Pluton</span></span> sank in deep
water a few minutes later. The destroyer probably
suffered much injury from the fire of the secondary
batteries of the battle-ships <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span>, and the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, yet I think a very considerable factor in their
speedy destruction was the fire, at close range, of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester’s</span></span> battery.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“After rescuing the survivors of the destroyers, the

the crew of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“8. The method of escape attempted by the
Spaniards—all steering in the same direction, and
in formation—removed all practical doubts or difficulties,
and made plain the duty of every United States
vessel to close in, immediately engage and pursue.
This was promptly and effectively done.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“As already stated, the first rush of the Spanish
squadron carried it past a number of the blockading
ships, which could not immediately work up to their
best speed, but they suffered heavily in passing, and
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oquendo</span></span> were probably
set on fire by the shells fired during the first fifteen
minutes of the engagement. It was afterward learned
that the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa’s</span></span> fire main had been cut
by one of our first shots, and that she was unable to
extinguish the fire.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“With large volumes of smoke rising from their lower

ran in on the beach, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span> at

    <span class="tei tei-q">“9. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span> was still under the fire of the
leading vessels. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span> had drawn ahead,

and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hist</span></span>, took off the crew of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>, while
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Harvard</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> rescued those of the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Almirante Oquendo</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“This rescue of prisoners, including the wounded
from the burning Spanish vessels, was the occasion of
some of the most daring and gallant conduct of the
day. The ships were burning fore and aft, their guns
and reserve ammunition were exploding, and it was not
known at what moment the fire would reach the main
magazine.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“In addition to this a heavy surf was running just
inside of the Spanish ships. But no risk deterred our
officers and men until their work of humanity was
complete.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“10. There remained now of the Spanish ships only
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span>, but she was their best and fastest
vessel. Forced by the situation to hug the Cuban
coast, her only chance of escape was by superior and
sustained speed.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“When the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span> went ashore the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Colon</span></span> was about
six miles ahead of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span>, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her spurt was finished, and the American ships were
now gaining upon her. Behind the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> and the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> came the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vixen</span></span>, 
        and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It was evident from the bridge of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>
that all the American ships were gradually overhauling
the chase, and that she had no chance of escape. At
12.50 the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> opened fire and
got her range,—the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon’s</span></span> heavy shells striking
beyond her,—and at 1.20 she gave up without firing
another shot, hauled down her colours and ran ashore
at Rio Tarquino, forty-eight miles from Santiago.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Captain Cook of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> went on board to
receive the surrender. While his boat was alongside I
came up in the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>, receiving his report, and
placed the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> in charge of the wreck to save her,
if possible, and directed the prisoners to be transferred
to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Resolute</span></span>, which had followed the chase. Commodore
Schley, whose chief of staff had gone on board
to receive the surrender, had directed that all their
personal effects should be retained by the officers.
This order I did not modify.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span> was not injured by our firing,
and probably is not injured by beaching, though she
ran ashore at high speed. The beach was so steep that
she came off by the working of the sea. But her sea
valves were opened or broken, treacherously, I am sure,
after her surrender, and despite all efforts she sank.
When it became evident that she could not be kept
afloat she was pushed by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span> bodily upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the beach, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York’s</span></span> stem being placed against
her for this purpose, the ship being handled by Captain
Chadwick with admirable judgment, and sank in shoal
water, and may be saved. Had this not been done she
would have gone down in deep water, and would have
been to a certainty a complete loss.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“11. I regard this complete and important victory
over the Spanish forces as the successful finish
of several weeks of arduous and close blockade, so
stringent and effective during the night that the enemy
was deterred from making the attempt to escape at
night, and deliberately elected to make the attempt in
daylight. That this was the case I was informed by
the commanding officer of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“12. It seems proper to briefly describe here the
manner in which this was accomplished. The harbour
of Santiago is naturally easy to blockade, there being
but one entrance and that a narrow one, and the deep
water extending close up to the shore line, presenting
no difficulties of navigation outside of the entrance.
At the time of my arrival before the port, June 1st,
the moon was at its full, and there was sufficient light
during the night to enable any movement outside of
the entrance to be detected; but with the waning
of the moon and the coming of dark nights there was
opportunity for the enemy to escape, or for his torpedo-boats
to make an attack upon the blockading vessels.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It was ascertained with fair conclusiveness that the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span>, so gallantly taken into the channel on June
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>3d, did not obstruct it. I therefore maintained the
blockade as follows: To the battle-ships was assigned
the duty, in turn, of lighting the channel. Moving up
to the port, at a distance of from one to two miles
from the Morro,—dependent upon the condition of the
atmosphere,—they threw a search-light beam directly
up the channel and held it steadily there.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“This lighted up the entire breadth of the channel
for half a mile inside of the entrance so brilliantly that
the movement of small boats could be detected.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Why the batteries never opened fire upon the
search-light-ship was always a matter of surprise to
me; but they never did. Stationed close to the entrance
of the port were three picket-launches, and, at
a little distance further out, three small picket-vessels—usually
converted yachts—and, when they were
available, one or two of our torpedo-boats.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“With this arrangement there was at least a certainty
that nothing could get out of the harbour undetected.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“After the arrival of the army, when the situation
forced upon the Spanish admiral a decision, our vigilance
increased. The night blockading distance was
reduced to two miles for all vessels, and a battle-ship
was placed alongside the search-light-ship, with her
broadside trained upon the channel in readiness to fire
the instant a Spanish ship should appear. The commanding
officers merit great praise for the perfect
manner in which they entered into this plan, and put
it into execution. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Massachusetts</span></span>, which, according
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to routine, was sent that morning to coal at Guantanamo,
like the others, had spent weary nights upon
this work, and deserved a better fate than to be absent
that morning.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I enclose, for the information of the department,
copies of orders and memorandums issued from time
to time, relating to the manner of maintaining the
blockade. When all the work was done so well, it is
difficult to discriminate in praise.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The object of the blockade of Cervera’s squadron
was fully accomplished, and each individual bore well
his part in it, the commodore in command of the second
division, the captains of ships, their officers, and men.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“13. The fire of the battle-ships was powerful and
destructive, and the resistance of the Spanish squadron
was, in great part, broken almost before they had
got beyond the range of their own force.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The fine speed of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> enabled her to take a
front position in the chase, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span> did
not give up until the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span> had thrown a 13-inch shell
beyond her. This performance adds to the already
brilliant record of this fine battle-ship, and speaks
highly of the skill and care with which her admirable
efficiency has been maintained during a service unprecedented
in the history of vessels of her class.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn’s</span></span> westerly blockading position gave
her an advantage in the chase which she maintained to
the end, and she employed her fine battery with telling
effect.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

first burst of speed, the result was never in doubt.
She fell, in fact, far below what might reasonably have
been expected of her.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Careful measurements of time and distance give her
an average speed, from the time she cleared the harbour

couple up their forward engines, but ran out of the
chase with one pair, getting steam, of course, as rapidly
as possible on all boilers. To stop to couple up the
forward engines would have meant a delay of fifteen
minutes, or four miles in the chase.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“14. Several of the ships were struck, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>
more often than the others, but very light material
injury was done, the greatest being aboard the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Iowa</span></span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Our loss was one man killed and one wounded, both
on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span>. It is difficult to explain the immunity
from loss of life or injury to ships in a combat with
modern vessels of the best type, but Spanish gunnery
is poor at the best, and the superior weight and accuracy
of our fire speedily drove the men from their guns and
silenced their fire.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“This is borne out by the statements of prisoners and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by observation. The Spanish vessels, as they dashed
out of the harbour, were covered with the smoke from
their own guns, but this speedily diminished in volume,
and soon almost disappeared.</span>

a few hours after my writing this.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“We were in a rather disgruntled frame of mind on
account of a little note from Shafter. He wanted to
know why the navy could not go under a destructive
fire as well as the army. It was decided to go and
have a consultation with him, explain the situation,
and lay our plans before him, which were to countermine
the harbour, going in at the same time, and
also trying to carry the Morro by assault with one
thousand marines landed in Estrella cove.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“It was arranged we were to go to Siboney about
9.30, so Sampson, Staunton, and I put on our leggings,
got some sandwiches, filled a flask, and the ship started
to go the seven miles to Siboney, where we were to
find horses and a cavalry escort.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“We were within a mile or so of the place when a
message came to me that a ship was coming out, and
by the time I was on deck I found the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>
turned around, and headed back, and there they were,
coming out one after the other, and putting west as
hard as they could go.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The situation was one which rather left us out of it.
We were too far off to shoot, but could see the rest
banging away. The last to come were the two torpedo-boat
destroyers, so we headed in to cut off any attempt
on their part to return to port, and we saw Wainwright
in the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> firing at them for all he was worth,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and soon one evidently had a hole through her boiler,
as there was a great white cloud of steam which shot
into the air. We fired two or three 4-inch shots at the
other, which was moving back toward the entrance, and
then left him to Wainwright’s mercy, as it was a clear
case, and stood on; in a few moments we came, first to
one and then the other, but a little way apart, the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Infanta Maria Teresa</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oquendo</span></span> afire and

to have mentioned two men in the water, stripped, to
whom we threw life-buoys, with which they expressed
themselves satisfied. It is impossible in such a case,
with two of the enemy’s ships going ahead of us, to
stop.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“We had not passed the two ships I mentioned far,
until we saw the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span> head in, and soon she was on
the beach and aflame, at Ascerraderos, right under the
old Cuban camp.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“There was still the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Cristobal Colon</span></span>, a good way
ahead, the newest and fastest and much more powerful.

burning <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>) and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span>, which we ordered to
return off the harbour, and tailed on to the procession

somewhat.</span>

Colon</span></span> gradually edge inshore, so that we knew the game
was up and the victory complete; soon she headed in,
and went under one of the points which come down
from the mountains, which here (some sixty miles west
of Santiago) are close at the water’s edge, and are the
highest (seventy-eight hundred feet) in Cuba. We hurried
forward and soon saw she had hauled her flag
down, and was ashore.</span>

as to which they seemed anxious.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“I then went on board and arranged things, the

them up among the ships (525 men) along came the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Resolute</span></span>, reporting having been chased by a Spanish
armoured ship, so we put all the prisoners in her. This

hurried a prize-crew aboard from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Oregon</span></span>, closed all
water-tight doors, as she was evidently leaking somewhere,
but for all we could do she settled down on the
beach after floating with the rising tide. It was a great
pity, but the rascally engineers’ force had opened all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the valves connecting with the sea, and we could not

back to our post off Santiago. The failure to save
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Colon</span></span> was too bad. It is possible to do so, of
course, with the assistance of a wrecking company, but
she was practically in an undamaged condition. She

we bombarded the forts very heavily, knocking off

of the western battery, who paid a great deal of attention
to us yesterday, banged away at us in fine style,

only to the torpedo-boat destroyers, came a tremendous
screech, and everybody on the forecastle
dodged. It was their last; it fell about two hundred
yards to our right. We did not reply as we came
along. I thought it a waste of material, and thought
they might have their amusement so long as they did
no damage.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the victory at El Caney and San Juan Hill
fresh in their minds, the American people believed
that the war was well-nigh at an end. Information
that Spain had sued for peace was hourly expected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was much to be done, however, before the
enemy was willing to admit himself beaten. The city
of Santiago yet remained in the hands of the Spaniards,
Manila was still defiant; and until those two
strongholds had been reduced, the boys of ’98 must
continue to struggle in the trenches and on the field.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The end was not far away, however.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 5.</span></span> General Shafter telegraphed to the War
Department on the fifth of July to the effect that the
people of Santiago were not only panic-stricken through
fear of bombardment, but were suffering from lack of
actual necessaries of life. There was no food save
rice, and the supply of that was exceedingly limited.
The belief of the war officials, however, was that the
Spaniards would fight to the last, and capitulate only
when it should become absolutely necessary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Meanwhile the soldiers were waiting eagerly for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>close of the truce, and, as the hour set by General
Shafter drew near, every nerve was strained to its
utmost tension once more. Then a white flag was
carried down the line, and all knew the truce had been
prolonged.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
General Kent, whose division was facing the hospital
and barracks of Santiago, was notified by the enemy
that Assistant Naval Constructor Hobson and his companions
were confined in the extreme northern building,
over which two white flags were flying.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The citizens of Santiago, learning that General Toral
refused to consider the question of surrender, began to
leave the city,—a mournful procession.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
General Shafter cabled to the government at Washington
under date of July 5th:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am just in receipt of a letter from General Toral,
agreeing to exchange Hobson and men here; to make
exchange in the morning. Yesterday he refused my
proposition of exchange.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 7.</span></span> General Miles and staff left Washington en

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lieutenant Hobson and the other <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Merrimac</span></span> heroes
were brought into the American lines on the morning
of the seventh. The exchange of prisoners had been
arranged to take place under a tree midway between
the entrenchments occupied by the Rough Riders and
the first lines of the Spanish position. Col. John
Jacob Astor represented the American commander,
and took with him to the rendezvous three Spanish
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lieutenants and fourteen other prisoners. Major Irles,
a Spanish staff officer, acted for the enemy. The
transfer was quickly effected, and once more the
brave fellows who had set their lives as a sacrifice
on the altar of their country were free.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 10.</span></span> The truce continued, with the exception of
a brief time on the tenth, when the bombardment was
resumed by the fleet, until the thirteenth, when Generals
Miles, Shafter, Wheeler, and Gilmour had an
interview with General Toral and his staff at a point
about halfway between the lines.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 13.</span></span> During this interview the situation was
placed frankly before General Toral, and he was offered
the alternative of being sent home with his garrison, or
leaving Santiago province, the only condition imposed
being that he should not destroy the existing fortifications,
and should leave his arms behind.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 17.</span></span> The ceremony of surrendering the city was
impressive, and, as can well be imagined, thrilling for
those boys of ’98 who had been standing face to face
with death in the trenches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At six o’clock in the morning Lieutenant Cook, of
General Shafter’s staff, entered the city, and all the
arms in the arsenal were turned over to him. The
work of removing the mines which obstructed navigation
at the entrance of the harbour had been progressing
all night. At about seven o’clock General Toral,
the Spanish commander, sent his sword to General
Shafter, as evidence of his submission, and at 8.45 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A. M.</span></span>
all the general officers and their staffs assembled at
General Shafter’s headquarters. Each regiment was
drawn up along the crest of the heights.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shortly after nine o’clock the Ninth Infantry entered
the city. This position of honour was given them as a
reward for their heroic assault on San Juan Hill.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The details of the surrender are thus described by a
correspondent of the Associated Press, who accompanied
General Shafter’s staff:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“General Shafter and his generals, with mounted
escort of one hundred picked men of the Second Cavalry,
then rode over our trenches to the open ground at
the foot of the hill on the main road to Santiago, midway
to the then deserted Spanish works. There they
were met by General Toral and his staff, all in full uniform
and mounted, and a select detachment of Spanish
troops.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“What followed took place in full view of our troops.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The scene was picturesque and dramatic. General
Shafter, with his generals and their staffs grouped
immediately in their rear, and with the troops of dashing
cavalrymen with drawn sabres on the left, advanced
to meet the vanquished foe.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“After a few words of courteous greeting, General
Shafter’s first act was to return General Toral’s sword.
The Spanish general appeared to be touched by the
complimentary words with which General Shafter accompanied
this action, and he thanked the American
commander feelingly.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Then followed a short conversation as to the place
selected for the Spanish forces to deposit their arms,
and a Spanish infantry detachment marched forward to
a position facing our cavalry, where the Spaniards were
halted. The latter were without their colours.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Eight Spanish trumpeters then saluted, and were
saluted, in turn, by our trumpeters, both giving flourishes
for lieutenant and major-generals.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“General Toral then personally ordered the Spanish
company, which in miniature represented the forces
under his command, to ground arms. Next, by his
direction, the company wheeled and marched across
our lines to the rear, and thence to the place selected
for camping them. The Spaniards moved rapidly, to
the quick notes of the Spanish march, played by the
companies; but it impressed one like the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Dead March’</span>
from Saul.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Although no attempt was made to humiliate them,
the Spanish soldiers seemed to feel their disgrace
keenly, and scarcely glanced at their conquerors as
they passed by. But this apparent depth of feeling
was not displayed by the other regiments. Without
being sullen, the Spaniards appeared to be utterly indifferent
to the reverses suffered by the Spanish arms,
and some of them, when not under the eyes of their
officers, seemed to secretly rejoice at the prospect of
food and an immediate return to Spain.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“General Toral, throughout the ceremony, was sorely
dejected. When General Shafter introduced him by
name to each member of his staff, the Spanish general
appeared to be a very broken man. He seems to be
about sixty years of age, and of frail constitution,
although stern resolution shone in every feature. The
lines are strongly marked, and his face is deep drawn,
as if with physical pain.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“General Toral replied with an air of abstraction
to the words addressed to him, and when he accompanied
General Shafter at the head of the escort into
the city, to take formal possession of Santiago, he
spoke but few words. The appealing faces of the
starving refugees streaming back into the city did not
move him, nor did the groups of Spanish soldiers
lining the road and gazing curiously at the fair-skinned,
stalwart-framed conquerors. Only once did a faint
shadow of a smile lurk about the corners of his mouth.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“This was when the cavalcade passed through a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>barbed-wire entanglement. No body of infantry could
ever have got through this defence alive, and General
Shafter’s remark about its resisting power found the
first gratifying echo in the defeated general’s heart.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Farther along the desperate character of the
Spanish resistance, as planned, amazed our officers.
Although primitive, it was well done. Each approach
to the city was thrice barricaded and wired, and the
barricades were high enough and sufficiently strong to
withstand shrapnel. The slaughter among our troops
would have been frightful had it ever become necessary
to storm the city.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Around the hospitals and public buildings and
along the west side of the line there were additional
works and emplacements for guns, though no guns
were mounted in them.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The streets of Santiago are crooked, with narrow
lines of one-storied houses, most of which are very
dilapidated, but every veranda of every house was
thronged by its curious inhabitants,—disarmed soldiers.
These were mostly of the lower classes.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Few expressions of any kind were heard along the
route. Here and there was a shout for free Cuba from
some Cuban sympathiser, but as a rule there were
only low mutterings. The better class of Spaniards
remained indoors, or satisfied their curiosity from
behind drawn blinds.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Several Spanish ladies in tumble-down carriages
averted their faces as we passed. The squalor in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>streets was frightful. The bones of dead horses and
other animals were bleaching in the streets, and buzzards,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The windows of the hospitals, in which there are
over fifteen hundred sick men, were crowded with
invalids, who dragged themselves there to witness our

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The palace was reached soon after ten o’clock.
There General Toral introduced General Shafter and
the other American generals to the alcalde, Señor

as well as to the other municipal authorities.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Luncheon was then served at the palace. The
meal consisted mainly of rum, wine, coffee, rice, and
toasted cake. This scant fare occasioned many apologies
on the part of the Spaniards, but it spoke eloquently
of their heroic resistance. The fruit supply of the city
was absolutely exhausted, and the Spaniards had nothing
to live on except rice, on which the soldiers in the
trenches of Santiago have subsisted for the last twelve
days.”</span>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ten thousand people witnessed the ceremony of
hoisting the stars and stripes over the governor’s palace
in Santiago.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A finer stage setting for a dramatic episode it would
be difficult to imagine. The palace, a picturesque old
dwelling in the Moorish style of architecture, faces
the Plaza de la Reina, the principal public square.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Opposite rises the imposing Catholic cathedral. On
one side is a quaint, brilliantly painted building with
broad verandas, the club of San Carlos; on the other
a building of much the same description, the Café de
la Venus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Across the plaza was drawn up the Ninth Infantry,
headed by the Sixth Cavalry band. In the street
facing the palace stood a picked troop of the Second
Cavalry, with drawn sabres, under command of Captain
Brett. Massed on the stone flagging between
the band and the line of horsemen were the brigade
commanders of General Shafter’s division, with their
staffs. On the red-tiled roof of the palace stood
Captain McKittrick, Lieutenant Miles, and Lieutenant
Wheeler. Immediately above them, above the flagstaff,
was the illuminated Spanish arms, and the legend,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vive Alphonso XIII.</span></span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All about, pressing against the veranda rails, crowding
to windows and doors, and lining the roofs, were
the people of the town, principally women and non-combatants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the chimes of the old cathedral rang out the hour
of twelve, the infantry and cavalry presented arms.
Every American uncovered, and Captain McKittrick
hoisted the stars and stripes. As the brilliant folds
unfurled in the gentle breeze against the fleckless sky,
the cavalry band broke into the strains of <span class="tei tei-q">“The Star
Spangled Banner,”</span> making the American pulse leap and
the American heart thrill with joy.

At the same instant the sound of the distant booming
of Captain Capron’s battery, firing a salute of twenty-one
guns, drifted in.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the music ceased, from all directions around
our lines came flying across the plaza the strains of the
regimental bands and the muffled, hoarse cheers of our
troops.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The infantry came to <span class="tei tei-q">“order arms”</span> a moment later,
after the flag was up, and the band played <span class="tei tei-q">“Rally
Round the Flag, Boys.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instantly General McKibben called for three cheers
for General Shafter, which were given with great
enthusiasm, the band playing <span class="tei tei-q">“The Stars and Stripes
For Ever.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ceremony over, General Shafter and his staff
returned to the American lines, leaving the city in the
possession of the municipal authorities subject to the
control of General McKibben, who had been appointed
temporary military governor.

the Spanish authorities at the capital of the Ladrone

undertake this job, and given 160 men to land as a
starter.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“I went ashore to have a talk with the governor
about affairs, and the results were that I did not lose

shore to hand you a letter and to get your reply;
in this reply, now in my hand, you agree to surrender
all under your jurisdiction. If this means anything at
all, it means that you will accede to any demands I may

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“They protested and demurred, saying there was not

was three miles away from my troops, and I had only
four men with me. At four <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P. M.</span></span>, when I disarmed 108

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The key-note to the whole business was my breaking
the seal of that letter and acting at once. They
had no time to delay or prepare any treacherous tricks,

out West.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Twenty-four hours would have—yes, I believe
even four hours with a leader such as the governor was,
a lieutenant-colonel in the Spanish army—given them
a chance to hide along the road to Agana, and at intervals
in the dense tropical foliage they could have almost
annihilated any force that could land.</span>

Saturday, June 25th, under convoy of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span>, commanded

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were 650 Cubans under Gen. Emilio Nunez, fifty
troopers of the Tenth U. S. Cavalry under Lieutenants
Johnson and Ahearn, and twenty-five Rough
Riders under Winthrop Chanler, brother of Col.
William Astor Chanler.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cargoes were enormous. There were the horses
of the cavalry and 167 sacks of oats and 216 bales of
hay to feed them. Topping the list of arms were two
dynamite guns, with 50-pound projectiles to fit them, and
two full batteries of light field-pieces, ten 3-inch rifles of
regular ordnance pattern, with harnesses that go with
them, and 1,500 cartridges. In the matter of infantry
rifles there were 4,000 Springfields, with 954,000
cartridges, and 200 Mausers, with 2,000 shells.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fifty of the Cubans aboard were armed with Mausers,
and the others had Springfields. For the insurgent officers
were provided 200 army Colts and 2,700 cartridges.
Two hundred books of United States cavalry and infantry
tactics, translated into Spanish, were taken along.
In the expedition were also 1,475 saddles, 950 saddle-cloths,
and 450 bridles. For the Cuban soldiers there
were taken 7,663 uniforms, 5,080 pairs of shoes, 1,275
blankets, 400 shirts, 450 hats and 250 hammocks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were these commissary stores carried, calculated
by pounds: Bacon, 67,275; corn-meal, 31,250;
roasted coffee, 10,200; raw coffee, 3,250; sugar, 2,425;
mess pork and beef, 9,600; corned beef, 24,000; beans
18,900; hardtack, 1,250; cans of corn, 1250.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 29.</span></span> The expectation was that the landing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would be effected at San Juan Point, on the south
coast of Cuba, midway between Cienfuegos and Trinidad.
This place was reached Wednesday evening,
June 29th. A scouting party put off in a small boat
and sculled toward shore, but had made only half the
distance when there came a lively fire from what had
been taken to be an abandoned blockhouse near the
point. The men were called back and the three ships
moved to the eastward. About four o’clock the next
afternoon they arrived at Las Tunas, forty miles away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Four miles west of the town, at the mouth of the
Tallabacoa River, stood a large fort built of railroad
iron and surrounded by earthworks. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span> ran
boldly in and fired several shots from her 3-pounders,
but brought no response and no signs of life. Here
was thought to be the desired opportunity, and another
scouting party was organised. This was made up of
fifteen volunteers under Winthrop Chanler, and as
many Cubans under Captain Nunez.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span> took a position within short range of the
fort to protect a landing or cover a retreat, and the
small boats headed for the shore. They reached it five
hundred yards east of the fort; the boats were beached,
and their occupants cautiously scrambled toward the
brush. But at almost the very moment they set foot
on the sand, the fort and the entrenchments around it
burst into flame, and shot and shell screamed about the
little band of invaders. Captain Nunez was stepping
from his boat when a shot struck him between the eyes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and he went down dead. Chanler fell with a broken
arm. The others safely gained a thicket and replied
with a sharp fire directed at the entrenchments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Meanwhile the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span> set all her guns at work, and
rained shells upon the fort until the enemy’s fire
ceased. The moment the gunboat slackened fire, however,
the Spanish fire was renewed with fury, and it
became evident that their forces were too large to allow
a landing there. A retreat was ordered, and the party
on shore rushed to the boats, but volley after volley
came from the shore, and they were compelled to throw
themselves into the water, and paddle alongside the
boats with only their heads exposed, until the ships
were reached. The Spaniards had the range, however,
and five Cubans were wounded, though none seriously.
Returning to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span>, the men reported that a
vicious fire had come from a grove of cocoanut palms
to the eastward of the fort. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span> opened her
guns on the place indicated, and must have killed many
Spaniards, for her shells dropped into the smoke and
flash of the adversary’s fire, silenced it at once, and
forced them to send up rockets for help.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A number of volleys were sent at the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span> with a
view to disabling her gunners, but they were badly
directed, and fell against her side and into the water.
When the small boats reached the ship it was dark.
Then the discovery was made that, besides Captain
Nunez, whose body was left on the beach, there were
missing, Chanler, Doctors Lund and Abbott, Lieutenant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Agramonte, and two Cubans. It was reported that
Chanler had been mortally wounded, and was kept hidden
in the bushes along the shore by the two doctors.
Rescue parties were immediately <a name="corr309" id="corr309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">organised</span>, composed
of volunteers, and no less than four were sent ashore
during the night. Toward morning Lieutenant Ahearn,
in charge of one of these, found Chanler and his
companion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Chanler’s wound proved to be in the right elbow.
After sunrise Agramonte and his Cubans were discovered
and brought off.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 1.</span></span> The next day the gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Helena</span></span>, under
Captain Swynburn, arrived, and she and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span>
steamed in toward Las Tunas, which the Spaniards
had been vigorously fortifying.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tunas is connected by rail with Sancti Spiritus, a
town of considerable size, and reinforcements and artillery
had been rapidly coming in. Range buoys had
been placed in the bay, but avoiding these, the ships
drew in to close range, and opened fire, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span> at
twelve hundred and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Helena</span></span> at fourteen hundred
yards. The Spaniards had several Krupp field-pieces
of three or four inches, mounted on earthworks along
the water-front, and they began a vigorous, but ill-directed
reply with shell and shrapnel. The fire of the
American ships was most accurate and terribly destructive.
The Spanish gunners had not fired more than
fifteen or twenty shots before their guns were flying
in the air, their earthworks a mass of blood-stained
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dust, and their gunners running for their lives. Both
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Peoria</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Helena</span></span> were struck several times,
chiefly by shrapnel, but no one on either ship was
injured. As they withdrew, several buildings on shore
were in flames.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That afternoon both ships again turned their attention
to the fort and the entrenchments at the mouth of
the Tallabacoa River, and for half an hour poured a
wicked fire upon them. The Spaniards had been
largely reinforced during the day, and some field-pieces
had been mounted near the fort. These replied to the
American fire, but without effect, and the shells of the
two ships speedily silenced them. The iron blockhouse
was struck repeatedly, and the earthworks were partially
destroyed. No damage was done to the ships,
and they again withdrew.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That night the Spaniards burned a large wharf and
the adjacent buildings, evidently expecting a landing in
force the next day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was learned from various sources that reinforcements
were pouring into Las Tunas from all directions;
a newspaper from Sancti Spiritus stated that two thousand
men had been despatched from the nearest trocha.
It was determined to proceed during the night to Palo
Alto, fifty miles to the eastward, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Helena</span></span> remaining
at Las Tunas to confirm the Spaniards in the belief
that an attempt was to be made to land there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 2.</span></span> At ten o’clock Saturday night, while the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Helena</span></span> lay offshore, making lively play with her

<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Fanita</span></span>, with all lights out, slipped silently away. Palo
Alto was reached at daybreak. There was not a
Spaniard to be seen, and the men and cargo were put
ashore without a single obstacle.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 5.</span></span> A steamer was sighted about midnight by
the U. S. S. <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hawk</span></span>, formerly the yacht <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermione</span></span>, off
the north coast of Pinar del Rio, steaming eastward,
close inshore. She paid no attention to three shots
across her bow, or a signal to heave to. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hawk</span></span>
then opened fire and gave chase.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Twenty-five shots were fired, of which only three
were without effect. The vessel was soon on fire, and
flew signals of distress while making full speed head on
to the beach. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hawk</span></span> ceased firing, and manned a
relief-boat just as the Spaniard ran high and dry on
a reef, under cover of Fort Mariel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though the Spaniard as yet had not fired a shot in
response to the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hawk’s</span></span> attack, and was burning signals
calling for help, the American relief-boat was received
with a joint volley from both the sinking steamer and
the neighbouring fort, turning her back, luckily unscathed,
By this time daylight was breaking, and
another Yankee ship, the gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Castine</span></span>, hove in sight,
reinforcing the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hawk</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two opened fire upon the Spanish vessel and
fort. A well-directed 4-inch shell from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Castine</span></span>
blew the steamer up.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of the latter’s crew and passengers by this time
had, however, escaped by rowing or swimming ashore.
Just at sunrise, while the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Castine</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Hawk</span></span> were
reconnoitring in the vicinity of the wreck, a big
Spanish gunboat hove in sight, training all her batteries
on the two American boats. It was an exciting
moment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Castine’s</span></span> 4-inchers opened promptly, and the
Spaniard returned at full speed to cover, under Morro
Castle.

The Spanish fleet, commanded by Admiral Camara,
arrived at Suez, and was notified by the officials of the

The government also notified Admiral Camara that
he would not be allowed to coal.

While the U. S. gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span> was on the blockading
route in the vicinity of the Isle of Pines, on the
south Cuban coast, about five miles from the shore,
she sighted the schooner <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gallito</span></span>, provision laden. She
immediately gave chase, and the schooner ran in until
about a quarter of a mile from the shore, when she
dropped her anchor, and those aboard slipped over her
side and swam ashore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ensign J. H. Roys and a crew of eight men from
the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span> were sent in a small boat to board the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>schooner. They found her deserted, and while examining
her were fired upon by her crew from the beach.
Several rifle-shots went through the schooner’s sails,
but no one was injured. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span> drew closer in, and
sent half a dozen shots toward the beach from her
6-pounders, whereupon the Spaniards disappeared. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gallito</span></span> was taken into Key West.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 8.</span></span> Admiral Camara, commander of the Spanish

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July 12.</span></span> The auxiliary gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span> sighted the
Spanish steamer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Santo Domingo</span></span>, fifty-five hundred
tons, aground near the Cuban coast, off Cape Francis,
and opened fire with her 6-pounders, sending seventy
shots at her, nearly all of which took effect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While this was going on, another steamer came out
of the bay and took off the officers and crew of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Santo Domingo</span></span>. When the men from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span>
boarded the latter they found that she carried two
5-inch and two 12-inch guns, the latter being loaded
and her magazines open. The steamer had been drawing
twenty-four feet of water and had gone aground
in twenty feet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The men from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span> decided that the steamer
could not be floated, and she was set on fire after
fifty head of cattle, which were on board, had been
shot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Santo Domingo</span></span> carried a large cargo of grain,
corn, etc. While the steamer was burning, the vessel
which had previously taken off the crew emerged from
the bay, and tried to get off some of the cargo, but
failed. The Spanish steamer burned for three days, and
was totally destroyed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bancroft’s</span></span> steam launch, in charge of Nevis and
one seaman, each armed with a rifle, were sent in to
take the schooner. This was only a task of minutes,
and the launch returned with the prize, which proved to
be the schooner <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Nito</span></span>, little more than a smack, and
with no cargo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

near the wreck of the Spanish transatlantic liner <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Santo

the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bancroft</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span> cruised off to Mangle Point,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>where they happened to be put in communication with
the insurgent camp.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two hours later they returned. For a time nothing
could be seen of the launch or the prize. Suddenly
Commander Clover, who was scanning the waters with
his glass, shouted to Captain Sutherland of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Eagle</span></span>:
<span class="tei tei-q">“By heavens, they have recaptured my prize.”</span> The
little schooner lay near the wrecked steamer, but
the Spanish flag was flying from her mast, and,
instead of only Nevis and his companion, she was
apparently filled with men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Meanwhile the gunboat <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maple</span></span> had drawn up, and
Commander Clover ordered her into the work of rescue.
With guns ready she steamed toward the schooner, but
the sight that greeted her was not what was expected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nevis and his companion sat at one end of the boat
attempting to navigate her out of the harbour. Each
had his rifle across his knee and was keeping a wary
eye on a party of half a dozen cowering Spaniards
huddled in the other end of the boat.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maple</span></span> asked for information, and offered Nevis
a tow, but he replied with a joke and declined the
proffered assistance. Then it developed that, in going
in to anchor, he had observed two other small Spanish
boats near the wreck of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Santo Domingo</span></span>, and
had resolved to capture them, too. He knew it was
hazardous work, but <span class="tei tei-q">“bluff”</span> carried him through.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He took the Spanish colours of the schooner, ran
them up, and boldly sailed in. There were six men on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the two other boats, and they watched the approach of
their supposed compatriots with calmness that speedily
changed to consternation when Nevis and the other
<span class="tei tei-q">“jackie”</span> suddenly whipped their rifles to their shoulders,
and demanded an immediate surrender.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The scared Spanish seamen lost no time in complying,
and had the unique experience of surrendering
to their own flag. Then, scorning all aid, Nevis took
them out to his ship, and in the most matter-of-fact
manner reported the adventure to his astonished commander.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The capture was no mean one, for these six men
gave important information to the American ships.

Wainwright, steaming into the harbour in
order to reconnoitre the place. With the fleet waiting
outside, the gallant little fighting yacht <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>
braved the mines which were supposed to be in this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>harbour, and, upon sounding, found that there were

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spaniards were completely taken by surprise.
Almost the first they knew of the approach of the
army of invasion was the firing of a gun from the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>, saucily demanding that the Spaniards haul
down the flag of Spain, which was floating from the
    <a name="corr321" id="corr321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">flagstaff</span> in front of a blockhouse standing to the east
of the village.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first 3-pounders were aimed at the hills right
and left of the bay and in order to scare the enemy,
the fighting yacht purposely avoiding firing into the
town.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> then hove to within about six hundred
yards of the shore, and lowered a launch, having on
board a colt rapid-fire gun and thirty men, under the
command of Lieutenant Huse. She was sent ashore
without encountering any opposition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Quartermaster Beck thereupon told Yeoman Lacey
to haul down the Spanish flag, which was done, and
then they raised the first United States flag to float over
Porto Rican soil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suddenly about thirty Spaniards opened fire with
Mauser rifles upon the American party. Lieutenant
Huse and his men responded with great gallantry, the
Colt gun doing effective work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Norman, who received Admiral Cervera’s surrender,
and Wood, a volunteer lieutenant, shared the honours
with Lieutenant Huse.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Almost immediately after the Spaniards fired on the
Americans, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span> opened fire on the enemy
with all her 3 and 6-pounders which could be brought
to bear, shelling the town and also dropping shells into
the hills to the west of Guanica, where a number of
Spanish cavalry were to be seen hastening toward the
spot where the Americans had landed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lieutenant Huse then threw up a little fort, which he
named Fort Wainwright, and laid barbed wire in the
street in front of it in order to repel the expected
cavalry attack. The lieutenant also mounted the Colt
gun and signalled for reinforcements, which were sent
from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloucester</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Presently a few of the Spanish cavalry joined those
who were fighting in the streets of Guanica, but the
Colt barked to a purpose, killing four of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Soon afterward white-coated galloping cavalrymen
were seen climbing the hills to the westward, and the
foot-soldiers were scurrying along the fences from the
town.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By 9.45, with the exception of a few guerrilla shots,
the town was won, and the enemy driven out of the
neighbourhood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The troops from the transports were landed before
nightfall.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>driven back a mile to a ridge, where the Spanish cavalry
charged and were routed by our infantry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
General Garretson led the fight with the men from
Illinois and Massachusetts, and the enemy retreated to
Yauco, leaving three dead on the field and thirteen

Colonel Hulings, with ten companies of the Sixteenth

miles of Coamo, and the Spanish rear guard was retiring
fast. The Spanish had fled toward Aibonito, thirty
miles from Ponce, and the place was being fortified.
There the road winds around among the mountains, and
the artillery commanding it rendered the position impregnable.
Détours were to be made by the Americans
from Coamo through Arroyo and Guayamo, thus avoiding
the main road, which had been mined for three
miles. Captain Confields of the engineers went ahead
to kill these mines. The Fifth Signal Corps men in advance
of the Sixteenth Pennsylvania sent word to General
Stone that it had reconnoitred the road to Adjuntas. A
signal-station was established, and the stars and stripes
run up at Santa Isabel amid great enthusiasm.

The Spaniards were eager for the fray, and early in

In about two hours the enemy abandoned the other
gun, and the men began to flee from the entrenchments
toward a banana growth near the gorge. Then the
guns shelled them as they ran. One gun was ordered
to advance a position a quarter of a mile farther
on. It had just reached the new position when
Spanish infantry reinforcements filed into the trenches
and began a deadly fire upon the Americans, compelling
the battery to retire at a gallop. Then
both the enemy’s howitzers reopened, the shrapnel
screamed, and Mausers sang. Another gun galloped
from the rear, but the American ammunition was
exhausted.

Colonel Bliss of General Wilson’s staff went forward
to the enemy’s lines with a flag of truce, and explained

not more than nine hundred Americans.

The latter showed great daring, approaching within
eight hundred yards of the Malate forts and trenches,
doing grand work and driving back the Spanish forces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The firing from the fleet continued for one hour, the
Spanish then retreating from Malate, where the fire was
centred, and the American land forces stormed the
trenches, sweeping all before them. The First
Colo<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rado Volunteers drove the Spaniards into the second
line of defence. Then the troops swept on, driving all
the Spaniards into the inner fortification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fighting in the trenches was most fierce. Fifteen
minutes after the Spaniards were driven to the
second line of defences, they were forced to retreat to
the walled city, where, seeing the uselessness of resistance,
they surrendered, and soon afterward a white
flag was hoisted over Manila.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The total number of killed on the American side was
forty-five, and wounded about one hundred. The
Spanish losses were two hundred killed and four hundred
wounded.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the twenty-sixth day of July, shortly after three
o’clock in the afternoon, the French ambassador,
M. Cambon, accompanied by his first secretary, called at
the White House, the interview having been previously
arranged and an intimation of its purpose having been
given. With the President at the time was Secretary
of State Day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
M. Cambon stated to the President that, representing
the diplomatic interests of the kingdom of Spain, <span class="tei tei-q">“with
whom at the present time the United States is unhappily
engaged in hostilities,”</span> he had been directed by
the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs to ask on
what terms the United States would agree to a suspension
of hostilities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The French ambassador, continuing, said that Spain,
realising the hopelessness of a conflict, knowing that
she was unable to cope with the great power of her
adversary, and appreciating fully that a prolongation of
the struggle would only entail a further sacrifice of life
and result in great misery to her people, on the ground
of humanity appealed to the President to consider a
proposition for peace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spain, said the ambassador, had been compelled to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fight to vindicate her honour, and having vindicated it,
having fought bravely and been conquered by a more
powerful nation, trusted to the magnanimity of the
victor to bring the war to an end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The President’s reply showed that he was responsive
to the appeal. He was evidently moved by the almost
pathetic position which the once proud nation of Spain
had been forced to take, but he had his feelings well
under control and behaved with great dignity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The President frankly admitted that he was desirous
of peace, that he would welcome a cessation of hostilities,
but he delicately intimated that if Spain were
really desirous of peace she must be prepared to offer
such terms as could be accepted by the United States.
The President asked the French ambassador if he had
been instructed to formally propose terms, or make any
offer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
M. Cambon replied that he had not been so instructed,
that his instructions were to ask on what
terms it would be possible to make peace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. McKinley said the matter would be considered
by the Cabinet, and a formal answer returned at the
earliest possible moment. The French ambassador
thanked the President for his courtesy, and, with
expressions of good-will on both sides, the historical
interview was brought to a close.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the thirtieth day of July the ultimatum of the
United States was delivered to the ambassador of France,
and, in plain words, it was substantially as follows:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The President does not now put forward any claim
for pecuniary indemnity, but requires the relinquishment
of all claim of sovereignty over or title to the
island of Cuba, as well as the immediate evacuation by
Spain of the island, the cession to the United States
and immediate evacuation of Porto Rico and other
islands under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies,
and the like cession of an island in the Ladrones.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The United States will occupy and hold the city, bay,
and harbour of Manila, pending the conclusion of a
treaty of peace, which shall determine the control,
disposition, and government of the Philippines.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If these terms are accepted by Spain in their entirety,
it is stated that the commissioners will be named
by the United States to meet commissioners on the part
of Spain for the purpose of concluding a treaty of peace
on the basis above indicated.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
August 12, 1898, peace negotiations were formally
begun between the United States and Spain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few minutes before four o’clock, in the midst of a
drenching rain, M. Cambon, the French ambassador,
attended by his secretary, entered the White House.
They were immediately ushered to the library, where
the President, Secretary of State Day, and Assistant
Secretaries of State Moore, Adee, and Cridler were
awaiting them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The President cordially greeted the ambassador, who
returned the salutation with equal warmth, and then
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shook hands with Secretary Day and the Assistant
Secretaries. While the President, Judge Day, and the
French ambassador were discussing the weather,—and
Washington has seldom known such a rain-storm as that
which engulfed the city while peace was being signed,—M.
Thiebaut and Assistant Secretary Moore were
comparing the two copies of the protocol to see that
they corresponded, and were identical in form.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The protocol is on parchment, in parallel columns in
French and English. In the copy retained by the
American government the English text is in the first
column; in the other copy, which was transmitted to
Madrid, the French text leads the paper.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two Secretaries having pronounced the protocol
correct, Judge Day and the French ambassador moved
over to the table to affix their signatures. Mr. Cridler
lit a candle to melt the sealing wax to make the impression
on the protocols.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The striking of the match caused the French ambassador
to stop, feel in his pocket, and then remember
that he had come away from his embassy without his
seal. Here was a contretemps. It would never do to
seal such an important document with anything else
but the ambassador’s personal seal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A note was hastily written, and one of the White
House messengers dashed out into the rain, and went
to the French embassy. Until his return the distinguished
party in the White House library continued to
discuss the weather, and wonder when the typical Cuban
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rain would cease falling. In a few minutes the messenger
returned. The ambassador drew from a small
box his seal, and the two plenipotentiaries turned to
the table. The American copy of the protocol was
placed before Judge Day, who signed it, and then
handed the pen to the ambassador, who quickly affixed
his signature and seal.
</p>
    <a name="ill62" id="ill62" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p><div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 100%; text-align: center"><img src="images/ill62.jpg" alt="DON CARLOS." title="DON CARLOS." /><div class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-top: 0.75em"><span style="font-size: 75%">DON CARLOS.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second copy was then laid before the ambassador,
who signed, and in turn handed back the pen to Judge
Day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus Judge Day signed the two documents, first and
last, and with the last stroke of his pen hostilities
ceased.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The number of islands in the Philippine group are
believed to be upwards of fourteen hundred, with an
aggregate land area (estimated on Domann’s map) of not less
than 114,356 miles, situate in the southeast of Asia, extending
from 40° 40′ to 20° north latitude, and from 116° 40′
to 126° 30′ east longitude.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The archipelago was discovered by Magellan on March
12, 1521, and named by him the St. Lazarus Islands. The
discoverer was a Portuguese, who had sought service under
Charles V. of Spain because he was ignored by the court of
his own country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the bull of Pope Alexander VI., of May 4, 1493,
which was then universally recognised as law, the earth was
divided into two hemispheres. All lands thereafter discovered
in the Eastern Hemisphere were decreed to belong
to Portugal; all the Western to Spain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The St. Lazarus Islands were well within Portugal’s
rights, but as the use of the log and the variation of the
compass were unknown, an error of fifty-two degrees in
longitude was made, and to Spain the islands were given
on the basis of that error.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By whom the name of Philippines was given to the
archipelago it is impossible to say. In 1567 it appears to
have been used for the first time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The manufactures of the islands consist of silk, cotton,
and piña fibres cloth, hats, mats, baskets, ropes, coarse
pottery, and musical instruments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The northern islands of the archipelago lie in the region
of the typhoon, and have three seasons,—the cold, the hot,
and the wet. The first extends from November to February
or March, when the atmosphere is bracing rather than cold.
The hot season lasts from March to June, and the heat
becomes very oppressive before the beginning of the southerly
monsoon. Thunder-storms of terrific violence occur
during May and June. The wet season begins with heavy
rains, known by the natives as <span class="tei tei-q">“collas,”</span> and until the end of
October the downpour is excessive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Earthquakes are sufficiently frequent and violent in the
Philippines to affect the style adopted in the erection of
buildings; in 1874, for instance, they were very numerous
throughout the archipelago, and in Manila and the adjacent
provinces shocks were felt daily for several weeks. The
most violent earthquakes on record in the Philippines occurred
in July, 1880, when the destruction of property was
immense, both in the capital and in other important towns
of central Luzon.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though situated in the equatorial region, the elevations
of the mountains give a range of climate that allows the
production of a great variety of valuable crops. Tobacco,
sugar, hemp, and rice are the chief staples produced. The
swamps and rivers are infested with crocodiles, and the
dense woods with monkeys and serpents of many species.
Rich deposits of gold are known to exist, but have been
little developed.

In the same district are found Indians, Negritos, Manthras,
Malays, Bicols, half-breed Indians and Spaniards,
Tagalas, Visayas, Sulus, and other tribes. The Negritos
(little negroes) are real negroes, blacker than a great many
of their African conquerors, with woolly hair growing in
isolated tufts. They are very diminutive, rarely attaining
four feet nine inches in height, and with small, retreating
skulls. This race forms a branch equal in importance to
the Papuan. It is believed to be the first race inhabiting
the Philippines, but, as well as everywhere else, except
in the Andaman Islands, it has been more or less absorbed
by the stronger races, and the result in the archipelago has
been the formation of several tribes of half-breeds numbering
considerably more than half a million. Side by side
with them, and equally poor and wretched, are the Manthras,
a cross between the Negritos and Malays and the degenerate
descendants of the Saletes, a warlike tribe conquered by
the Malayan Rajah Permicuri in 1411. Then come the
Malay Sulus, all Mohammedans and still governed by their
Sultan and their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">datos</span></span>, feudal lords who, under the suzerainty
of the Spaniards, have possessed considerable power.

The soil is fully sufficient—indeed, more than sufficient—to
support this population, whose wants are of the most
limited character. The land is exceedingly fertile and bears
in abundance all tropical products, particularly rice, sugar,
and the abaca, a variety of the banana-tree. The fibres of
the abaca are employed in making the finest and most
delicate fabrics, of which from three to four million dollars’
worth are exported annually. The exports of sugar amount
to about four millions and a half, of gold to two millions
and a half, and of coffee and tobacco close on to a million
and a quarter each. The rice is consumed at home. It
forms the staple food of the people, and nearly three million
dollars’ worth is imported yearly. The husbandman cannot
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>complain that his toil is inadequately rewarded. A rice
plantation will yield a return of at least fifteen per cent.; if
he plant his farm with sugar-cane he will realise thirty per
cent., if not more. On the other hand, the price of labour
is very low. An adult who gains a <span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">real fuerte</span></span> (about thirteen
cents) a day, thinks he is doing well.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this archipelago of the Philippines, where races, manners,
and traditions are so often in collision, the religious
fanaticism of the Spaniards has, more than once, come into
conflict with a fanaticism fully as fierce as that of the Mussulman.
At a distance of six thousand leagues from Toledo
and Granada, the same ancient hatreds have brought European
Spaniards and Asiatic Saracens into the same relentless
antagonism that swayed them in the days of the Cid and
Ferdinand the Catholic. The island of Sulu, on account of
its position between Mindanao and Borneo, was the commercial,
political, and religious centre of the followers of the
Prophet, the Mecca of the extreme Orient. From this centre
they spread over the neighbouring archipelago. Dreaded
as merciless pirates and unflinching fanatics, they scattered
everywhere terror, ruin, and death, sailing in their light
proas up the narrow channels and animated with implacable
hatred for those conquering invaders, to whom they never
gave quarter and from whom they never expected it; constantly
beaten in pitched battle, they as constantly took
again to the sea, eluding pursuit of the heavy Spanish
vessels, taking refuge in bays and creeks where no one
could follow them, pillaging isolated ships, surprising
the villages, massacring the old men, leading away the
women and the adults into slavery, pushing the audacious
prows of their skiffs even up to within three hundred miles
of Manila, and seizing every year nearly four thousand
captives.

Between the Malay creese and the Castilian carronade
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the struggle was unequal, but it did not last the less long on
that account, nor, obscure though it was, was it the less
bloody. On both sides there was the same bravery, the
same cruelty. It required all the tenacity of Spain to purge
these seas of the pirates who infested them, and it was not
until after a conflict of several years, in 1876, that the Spanish
squadron was able to bring its broadside to bear on
Tianggi, that nest of the Suluan pirates, land a division of
troops, invest all the outlets, and burn up the town and its
inhabitants as well as its harbour and all the craft within it.
The soldiers planted their flag and the engineers built a
new city on the smoking ruins. This city is protected
by a strong garrison. For a time, at least, it was all over
with piracy, but not with Moslem fanaticism, which was
exasperated rather than crushed by its defeat. To the
rovers of the seas succeeded the organisation known as
<span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">juramentados</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the characteristic qualities of the Malays is their
contempt of death. They have transmitted it with their
blood to the Polynesians, who see in it only one of the
multiple phenomena and not the supreme act of existence,
and witness it or submit to it with profound indifference.
Travellers have often seen a Canaque stretch his body on a
mat, while in perfect health, and without any symptom of
disease whatever, and there wait patiently for the end, convinced
that it is near, and refuse all nourishment and die
without any apparent suffering. His relatives say of him,
<span class="tei tei-q">“He feels he is going to die,”</span> and the imaginary patient
dies, his mind possessed by some illusion, some superstitious
idea, some invisible wound through which life escapes.
When to this absolute indifference to death is united
Mussulman fanaticism, which gives to the believer a glimpse
of the gates of a paradise where the abnormally excited
senses revel in endless and numberless enjoyments, a
long<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing for extinction takes hold of him and throws him like a
wild beast on his enemies; he stabs them and gladly invites
their daggers in return. The <span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">juramentado</span></span> kills for the sake
of killing, and being killed, and so winning, in exchange for
a life of privation and suffering, the voluptuous existence
promised by Mahomet to his followers.

The laws of Sulu make the bankrupt debtor the slave of
his creditor, and not only the man himself, but his family
also are enslaved. To free them there is only one means
left to the husband, the sacrifice of his life. Reduced to
this extremity he does not hesitate, he takes the formidable
oath. From that time forward he is enrolled in the ranks
of the <span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">juramentados</span></span>, and has nothing to do but await the
hour when the will of his superior shall let him loose upon
the Christians. Meanwhile the <span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">panditas</span></span>, or priests, subject
him to a system of enthusiastic excitement that will turn
him into a wild beast of the most formidable kind. They
madden his already disordered brain, they make still more
supple his oily limbs, until they have the strength of steel
and the nervous force of the tiger or panther. They sing
to him their rhythmic impassioned chants, which show to
his entranced vision the radiant smiles of intoxicating
houris. In the shadow of the lofty forests, broken by the
gleam of the moonlight, they evoke the burning and sensual
energies of the eternally young and beautiful companions
who are calling him, opening their arms to receive
him. Thus prepared, the <span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">juramentado</span></span> is ready for everything.
Nothing can stop him, nothing can make him recoil.
He will accomplish prodigies of valour. Though stricken ten
times he will remain on his feet, will strike back, borne
along by a buoyancy that is irresistible, until the moment
when death seizes him. He will creep with his companions
into the city that has been assigned to him; he knows that
he will never leave it, but he knows also that he will not die
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>alone, and he has but one aim,—to butcher as many

An eminent scientist, Doctor Montano, sent on a mission
to the Philippines by the French government, describes the
entry of eleven <span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">juramentados</span></span> into Tianggi. Divided into
three or four bands, they managed to get through the gates
of the town bending under loads of fodder for cattle which
they pretended to have for sale, and in which they had
hidden their creeses. Quick as lightning they stabbed
the guards, then, in their frenzied course, they struck all
whom they met.

Hearing the cry of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">Los juramentados!</span></span>”</span> the soldiers
seized their arms. The <span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">juramentados</span></span> rushed on them fearlessly,
their creeses clutched in their hands. The bullets
fell like hail among them. They bent, crept, glided, and
struck. One of them, whose breast was pierced through
and through by a bullet, rose and flung himself on the
troops. He was again transfixed by a bayonet; he remained
erect, vainly trying to reach his enemy, who held
him impaled on the weapon. Another soldier had to run up
and blow the man’s brains out before he let go his prey.
When the last of the <span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">juramentados</span></span> had fallen, and the corpses
were picked up from the street which consternation had
rendered empty, it was found that these eleven men had,
with their creeses, hacked fifteen soldiers to pieces, not to
reckon the wounded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And what wounds!”</span> exclaims Doctor Montano; <span class="tei tei-q">“the
head of one corpse is cut off as clean as if it had been done
with the sharpest razor; another soldier is almost cut in
two! The first of the wounded to come under my hands
was a soldier of the Third Regiment, who was mounting
guard at the gate through which some of the assassins
entered. His left arm was fractured in three places; his
shoulder and breast were literally cut up like mince-meat;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>amputation appeared to be the only chance for him; but in

It is easily seen how precarious and nominal has been
Spanish rule on most of the islands of this vast archipelago.
In the interior of the great island of Mindanao there is no
system of control, no pretence even of maintaining order.
It is a land of terror, the realm of anarchy and cruelty.
There murder is a regular institution. A <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bagani</span></span>, or man of
might, is a gallant warrior who has cut off sixty heads. The
number is carefully verified by the tribal authorities, and
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bagani</span></span> alone possesses the right to wear a scarlet turban.
All the batos, or chiefs, are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">baganis</span></span>. It is carnage organised,
honoured, and consecrated; and so the depopulation is
frightful, the wretchedness unspeakable.

The Mandayas are forced to seek a refuge from would-be
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">baganis</span></span> by perching on the tops of trees like birds, but their
aerial abodes do not always shelter them from their enemies.
They build a hut on a trunk from forty to fifty feet in height,
and huddle together in it to pass the night, and to be in
sufficient numbers to repulse their assailants. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">baganis</span></span>
generally try to take their victims by surprise, and begin
their attack with burning arrows, with which they endeavour
to set on fire the bamboo roof. Sometimes the besiegers
form a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">testudo</span></span>, like the ancient Romans, with their locked
shields, and advance under cover up to the posts, which
they attack with their axes, while the besieged hurl down
showers of stones upon their heads. But, once their ammunition
is exhausted, the hapless Mandayas have nothing to
do but witness, as impotent spectators, the work of destruction,
until the moment comes when their habitation topples
over and falls. Then the captives are divided among the
assailants. The heads of the old men and of the wounded are
cut off, and the women and children are led away as slaves.

The genius of destructiveness seems incarnate in this
Malay race. The missionaries alone venture to travel
among these ferocious tribes. They, too, have made the
sacrifice of their lives, and, holding life worth nothing, they
have succeeded in winning the respect of these savages in
evangelising and converting them. They work for God
and for their country, and the poorest and most wretched
among the natives are not unwilling to accept the faith and
to submit to Spain; but the missionaries insist on their
leaving their homes and going to another district, to which,
for many reasons, the neophytes gladly consent. After
several days’ journey a pueblo is founded. These villages
have multiplied for many years past, forming oases of comparative
peace and civilisation amid the barbarism by which
they are surrounded, and are open to all who choose to seek
a shelter in them. The more neophytes the pueblo holds,
the less exposed it is to hostile incursions. Doctor Montano
gives a very striking account of one of these daring missionaries,
Father Saturnino Urios, of the Society of Jesus,
who, in a single year, converted and baptised fifty-two hundred
people.

There are thirty-one islands of considerable size in the

Pine and fir-trees are abundant. Large areas are suitable
for wheat. There are eight ports open to commerce. The
principal exports are hemp, sugar, rice, tobacco, cigars,
coffee, and cocoa. Previous to the rebellion the annual

agriculture, industry, and commerce (dating from 1866), and
a council of administration. In the provinces and districts
the chief power is in the hands of alcades mayores and civico-military
governors. The chief magistrate of a commune
is known as the gobernadorcillo, or captain; the native who
is responsible for the collection of the tribute of a certain
group of families is the cabeca de barangay. Every Indian
between the ages of sixteen and sixty, subject to Spain, was
forced to pay tribute to the amount of $1.17, descendants of
the first Christians of Cebu, new converts, gobernadorcillos,

The city was founded in 1571, and is situated on the
eastern shore of a circular bay 120 nautical miles in circumference.
It looks like a fragment of Spain transplanted to
the archipelago of Asia. On its churches and convents, even
on its ruined walls, overturned in the earthquake of 1863,
time has laid the brown, sombre, dull gold colouring of the
mother country. The ancient city, silent and melancholy,
stretches interminably along its gloomy streets, bordered
with convents whose flat façades are only broken here and
there by a few narrow windows. But there is also a new
city within the ramparts of Manila; it is sometimes called
the Escolta, from the name of its central quarter, and this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>city is alive with its dashing teams, its noisy crowd of Tagala

The primary cause of the Philippine rebellion was excessive
taxation by Spain to raise money to carry on the war in

Extreme cruelties began when General Aguirre arrived

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with bracelets, earrings, and chains. Many of the males
are similarly attired. Everybody smokes. Cigarettes at fifteen
for a cent are in chief favour with the natives. Cigars
at $1.50 a hundred are in favour with the foreigners. The
handful of Englishmen resident in Manila are mostly bachelors,
eager to make their pile and return to pleasanter
surroundings. These take up their quarters in a large
house at Sampalog, which is club and boarding-house combined,
or in <span class="tei tei-q">“chummeries,”</span> established in adjacent buildings.

The Spaniards classify all the Philippine islanders under
three religious groups,—the infidels, who have held to their
ancient heathen rights, the Moors, who retain the Mahometan
religion of their first conquerors, and the infinitely
larger class of Catholics.

An important, though numerically small, element in the
population of the larger cities are the mestizos, or half-breeds,
the result of admixture either between the Chinese
or the Spanish and the natives. These mestizos occupy
about the same social position as the mulattos of the United
States. But they are the richest and most enterprising
among the native population.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most important personage is the cura, or parish
priest. He is in most instances a Spaniard by birth, and
enrolled in one or other of the three great religious orders,
Augustinian, Franciscan, or Dominican, established by the
conquerors. At heart, however, he is usually as much, if
not more, of a native than the natives themselves. He is
bound for life to the land of his adoption. He has no social
or domestic tie, no anticipated home return, to bind him to
any other place.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next to the church, the greatest Sunday and holiday
resort in a Philippine village is the cock-pit, usually a
large building wattled like a coarse basket and surrounded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by a high paling of the same description, which forms a sort
of courtyard, where cocks are kept waiting their turn to
come upon the stage, when their owners have succeeded in
arranging a satisfactory match. It is claimed that many a
respectable Malay father has been seen escaping from amid
the ruins of his burning home bearing away in his arms his
favourite bird, while wife and children were left to shift for
themselves.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The diet of the Philippines has something to do, undoubtedly,
with their gentle and non-aggressive qualities. They
eschew opium and spirituous liquors. Their chief sustenance,
morning, noon, and eve, is rice. The rice crop seldom
fails, not merely to support the population, but to leave a
large margin for export. Famine, that hideous shadow
which broods over so many a rice-subsisting population, is
unknown here. Even scarcity is of rare occurrence. In the
worst of years hardly a sack of grain has to be imported.
It is this very abundance which stands in the way of what
the world calls progress. The Malay, like other children of
the tropics, limits his labour by the measure of his requirements,
and that measure is narrow indeed. Hence it is often
difficult to obtain his services in the development of the tobacco,
coffee, hemp, and sugar industries, which might make
the archipelago one of the wealthiest and most prosperous
portions of the earth’s face.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Manila has been once before captured from Spain. The
English were its captors, although they held it only a few
months. It was in 1762, a few weeks after the English
capture of Havana. Spain had been rash enough to side
with France in the war usually known in this country as the
French and Indian war. She was speedily punished for it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The expedition against Manila was the plan of Colonel
William Draper; he was made a brigadier-general for the
expedition and put in command, with Admiral Cornish as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his naval ally. There were nine ships of the line and frigates,
several troop-ships, and a land force of twenty-three hundred
including one English regiment, with Sepoys and marines.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On September 24, 1762, these forces were disembarked
just south of Manila. The Archbishop of Manila, who was
also governor-general of the island, collected and armed
some ten thousand natives, as a reinforcement to the
Spanish garrison of eight hundred. During the progress of
the siege some daring attempts were made by the British to
prevent the further construction of defences, but the assailants
were repulsed with great slaughter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A desperate sally was made by a strong body of natives,
who <span class="tei tei-q">“ran furiously on the ranks of the besiegers and fought
with almost incredible ferocity, and many of them died, like
wild beasts, gnawing with their teeth the bayonets by
which they were transfixed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On October 6th a breach was effected in the Spanish works,
the English carried the city by storm, and gave it up for
several hours to the ravages of a merciless soldiery. The
Archbishop and his officers had retired to the citadel, but
this could not be defended, and a capitulation was agreed
upon, by which the city and port of Manila, with several
ships and the military stores, were surrendered, while for
their private property the Spanish agreed to pay as a ransom
$2,000,000 in coin, and the same in bills on the treasury
at Madrid. This last obligation was never paid.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are ten principal classes of vessels in the
United States navy, distinguished one from another
by the differences in their uses and by their strength and
speed. The general principle underlying their construction is
that a vessel which is not strong enough to fight one of her
own size must be fast enough to run away. Any vessel
which is inferior in armament, and has no compensating
superiority in speed, is outclassed. The same is true of any
vessel which is equal in armament, but inferior in speed to
an adversary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The size of a vessel is measured by its displacement.
This displacement is the number of tons of water she will
push aside to make room for herself. A vessel of ten thousand
tons will take engines of a certain weight and power to
drive her at a given speed, and the larger the engine the
larger the boilers and the greater the supply of coal required.
Now, if it is necessary to give this vessel heavy protective
armour and big guns, the additional weight of this equipment
must be saved somewhere else, and usually in the
engine-room, reducing the speed of the vessel. Following
out this principle, it will be found that the fastest ships
carry the lightest armament, and that those which carry the
biggest guns in their batteries and the thickest armour on
their sides are comparatively slow, the extreme variation
among vessels of the same displacement being about eight
or nine miles an hour.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the matter of attack and defence, vessels are distinguished
by the number and weight of the guns they carry,
and by the distribution and thickness of their armour.
Protective armour is of two kinds, that which surrounds the
guns, so as to protect them from the enemy’s fire, and that
which protects the motive-power of the ship, so as to prevent
the engines from being rendered useless.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The maximum of guns and armour and the minimum of
speed are to be found in the first-class battle-ship, which is
simply a floating fortress, so constructed that she need
never run away, but can stand up and fight as long as her
gun turrets revolve. The general plan of construction in a
battle-ship is to surround the engines, boilers, and magazines
with a wall of Harveyized steel armour eighteen
inches or so thick, and seven or eight feet high, which
extends about four feet below the water-line and three feet
above it. This armour belt is not only on the sides of the
ship, but is carried across it fore and aft, immediately in
front of and behind the space occupied by the engines and
magazines, and the whole affair is covered with a solid steel
roof three or four inches thick. Outside this central fortress,
and extending from it clear to the bow and stern at
each end, is a protective deck of steel, three inches thick,
which is placed several feet below the water-line. Everything
above this deck and outside this fortress might be
shot away, and the vessel would still float and fight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the roof of the fortress are placed the turrets containing
the big guns. The largest of these guns, 13-inch calibre,
weigh about sixty tons each, and will carry a shell weighing
eleven hundred pounds about twelve miles. The turrets
are circular, as a rule, large enough to hold two guns, and
are made of face-hardened steel from fifteen to eighteen
inches thick. They revolve within a barbette or ring of
steel eighteen inches thick, which protects the machinery by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which the guns are trained. Farther back on the roof of
the fortress are other and lighter turrets made of 8-inch
steel and carrying 8-inch guns, and at other places are
stationed rapid-fire guns of lighter calibre, protected by
thinner armour than that of the main belt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If all this secondary battery is stripped off, leaving
nothing but the turrets with the big guns, and these are
brought down close to the water, and the armour belt is
reduced to seven or eight inches in thickness, the type of
vessel known as the monitor is reached. It is simply a
battle-ship on a reduced scale. Such vessels are very slow
and cannot stand rough weather, on account of their low
freeboard. The speed of the monitors is seldom more than
twelve or fourteen miles an hour, and they are intended to
act in coast defence, usually in connection with shore-batteries.
The best types in the navy are the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Terror</span></span> and the
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Puritan</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The speed of a battle-ship is about eighteen miles an
hour. The best specimen in the navy is the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiana</span></span>, declared
by its admirers to be the most powerful battle-ship
afloat. Second-class battle-ships, like the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Texas</span></span>, are smaller
vessels, usually about seven thousand tons, and they have
a much lighter armour belt, about twelve inches, and do not
carry so heavy an armament as ships of the first class. The
<span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Maine</span></span> was a second-class battle-ship. Her largest guns
were of 10-inch calibre; her armour was twelve inches thick,
and her turrets were eight inches thick only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first step in reducing the armament from that of the
battle-ship proper, at the same time increasing the speed,
produces the armoured cruiser. This type of vessel may
carry no guns of more than 8-inch calibre, and the armour
belt is reduced to three or four inches in thickness. Instead
of the roof over the armour belt, the protective deck is carried
all over the ship, but it is not flat, nor is it of equal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thickness, as in a battle-ship. On the top and in the middle
it is three inches thick, but the sides are six inches and they
slope abruptly to below the water-line. Between these
sloping sides and the thin armour belt coal is stored, so
that a shell would have to penetrate the outer belt, six or
eight feet of coal, and a sloping belt of steel six inches
thick, the total resistance of which is calculated to be equal
to a solid horizontal armour plate fifteen inches thick.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A cruiser is not supposed to fight with a battle-ship,
because it could not accomplish anything with its 8-inch
guns against the 18-inch armour of its heavier rival, while
one well-directed shot from the 12-inch guns of a battle-ship
or monitor would probably sink any armoured cruiser afloat.
For this reason the cruiser must be faster than the battle-ship,
so that she can run away, and the weight that is saved
in the armour belt and big guns is therefore put into the
engine-room. The average speed of an armoured cruiser is
about twenty-four miles an hour, and the best types of this
class in the navy are probably the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Brooklyn</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">New York</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some vessels, like the Spaniard <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>, are about half
way between a battle-ship and a cruiser, having the heavy
guns of the former and the speed of the latter. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Vizcaya</span></span>,
although a cruiser, carried 11-inch guns with a 12-inch
armour belt, and had a speed of twenty-three miles an hour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next step in reducing armament and increasing
speed, produced the protected cruiser, which carries no
armour belt, but retains the protective deck, upon the
sloping sides of which is stored the coal. The turrets
disappear altogether, and there is usually only one 8-inch
gun, the battery being principally made up of 4-inch rapid-fire
guns and 6, 4, and 1-pounders. As this class of vessel
is not able to cope with the armoured cruiser, it must be
faster, for the general principle holds good that the weaker
the vessel becomes in point of offensive weapons or defensive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>armour, the greater the necessity that she should be able to
run away. The best types of the protected cruiser in the
navy may be found in the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Columbia</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Minneapolis</span></span>, which
have a speed of about twenty-seven miles an hour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The weakest class of all is composed of the unprotected
cruisers, which have neither armour-belt nor protective deck,
and carry only light batteries of rapid-fire guns. When these
vessels are slow, like the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Detroit</span></span>, they are intended for long
voyages and for duty in foreign countries, and are of little
use in a sea fight. The very fast unprotected cruiser, like
the American line steamers, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Paul</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Louis</span></span>, attach
little importance to their armament, and rely for protection
upon stowing the coal behind the place occupied by the
armour belt in other vessels. All the beautiful wood-work,
which was so much admired in these vessels, was ripped
out to make room for these coal-bunkers, which are sufficient
to protect them from anything but the heaviest guns.
On account of their extreme weakness as fighters, these
cruisers are necessarily the fastest of all the large vessels,
and can run away from anything. For this reason no
concern was felt for the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Paris</span></span> by those who knew the
principles which govern the safety of modern vessels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The various types of cruisers are not expected to fight
with any but vessels of their own class, which they may
encounter in the discharge of similar duties, such as scouring
the seas as the advance guard of the slower line of
battle-ships, preying upon or escorting merchant vessels,
blockading ports, and acting as convoys for troop-ships.
Gunboats are simply light-draught cruisers, and are intended
for use in shallow waters and rivers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Torpedo-boats, as their name implies, depend entirely
upon the torpedo as the weapon of attack, and they carry
no guns except a very few light-calibre rapid-fires to keep
off small boats. Their success depends on their ability
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to approach a vessel very rapidly, launch their torpedo, and
retreat before they are detected and sunk. Speed is their
great requisite, and a torpedo-boat like the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Porter</span></span> can speed
thirty-two miles an hour. Naval experts consider their bark
worse than their bite, because, with the modern system of
lookouts and search-lights, and the accuracy and rapidity
of the secondary batteries, it is impossible for a torpedo-boat
to get within range without exposing itself to instant
destruction, and after a torpedo-fleet has once met with a
serious repulse, it is believed that it would be almost
impossible to get the crews to go into action again.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The torpedo-boat destroyer, contrary to general belief,
does not carry any heavy guns, but depends on its great
speed and its ability to cripple a torpedo-boat with its
6-pounders while keeping out of range of the enemy’s tubes.
All torpedo-boat destroyers carry torpedo tubes themselves,
so that they can be used against the enemy’s battle-ships or
cruisers if the occasion offers. The fastest boat in the
United States navy is the destroyer <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bailey</span></span>, which can steam
thirty-four miles an hour.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a naval battle the success or failure of a fleet may
depend on keeping open communication between the different
vessels of the squadron engaged. Owing to the fact
that the surface of the sea would often be obscured by the
smoke of battle, the difficulty of this is apparent, and naval
experts have been kept busy devising some method by which
the flag-ship can communicate with the other vessels of the
squadron at all times and under all conditions. So far
nothing has been put in general service which meets this
demand, but lately there have been experiments with the
telephone, which, it is said, can be used without wires, by
which signals can be projected by a vibrator on one vessel
against a receiver on another. The Navy Department is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>keeping the details of this new system carefully to itself, as
it desires to have the invention for the exclusive use of our
own ships of battle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The present method of communication is by the use of
flags representing numerals which are displayed in the rigging;
by the use of the Ardois system of lights for night
work; by the Myer code of wigwag signals, and by the use
of the heliograph. As it is of the utmost importance that
the enemy should not read the message, the signal books on
board a vessel are protected with the greatest care, and are
destroyed along with the cipher code whenever it is seen that
capture is inevitable. The semaphore system in use in the
British navy was tried for a time aboard some of our vessels,
but it never became popular, and has been abandoned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In signalling by the navy code, the sentence to be sent is
looked up in the code-book and its corresponding number is
obtained. This number is never more than four figures, on
account of the necessity of setting the signal with the least
delay. The number having been obtained, the quartermaster
in charge of the signal-chest proceeds to bend the
flags representing the numerals to the signal halliards, so as
to read from the top down. These flags represent the numerals
from one to nine and cipher, and there is a triangular
pennant termed a repeater, which is used in a combination
where one or more numerals recur. The numbers refer to
those found in the general signal-book, in which are printed
all the words, phrases, and sentences necessary to frame an
order, make an inquiry, indicate a geographical position, or
signal a compass course. Answering, interrogatory, preparatory,
and geographical pennants form part of this code; also
telegraph, danger, despatch, and quarantine flags.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The signal, having been prepared, is hoisted and left
flying until the vessel to which the message has been sent
signifies that it is understood by hoisting what is called the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>answering pennant. If the number hoisted by the flag-ship
is a preparatory order for a fleet movement, it is left flying
until all the vessels of the fleet have answered, and then is
pulled down, the act of pulling the signal down being understood
as the command for the execution of the movement
just communicated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is often necessary for a man-of-war to communicate
with a merchant vessel, or with some other war-ship belonging
to a foreign country. For this purpose the international
code is also carried in the signal-chest. These signals are
those in general use by all the merchant navies of the
world for communication by day at sea. There are eighteen
flags and a code pennant, corresponding to the consonants
of the alphabet, omitting x and z. The code pennant
is also used with these signals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If a message is to be sent at night, the Ardois system of
night signals, with which all our vessels carrying an electric
plant are fitted, is employed. These signals consist essentially
of five groups of double lamps, the two lamps in each
group containing incandescent electric lamps, and showing
white and red respectively. By the combination of these
lights letters can be formed, and so, letter by letter, a word,
and hence an order, can be spelled out for the guidance of
the ships of the squadron. These lamps are suspended on
a stay in the rigging, and are worked by a keyboard from the
upper bridge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the smaller ships of the service, those which are not
fitted with electric lighting, Very’s night signals are used.
This set includes the implements for firing and recharging
the signals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The latter show green and red stars on being projected
from pistols made for them. The combination in various
ways is used to express the numbers from one to nine and
cipher, so that the numbers, to four digits, contained in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>signal-book, may be displayed. The Myer wigwag system is
employed either by day or by night. Flags and torches are
employed. The official flag is a red field with a small white
square in the centre; the unofficial flag is the same with the
colours reversed. The operator, having attracted the attention
of the ship which is to be signalled by waving the flag
or torch from right to left, transmits his message by motions
right, left, and front, each motion the element of a letter of
the alphabet, the letter being made up of from one to four
motions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When circumstances permit, the heliograph is sometimes
used. The rays of the sun are thrown by a system of
mirrors to the point with which it is desired to communicate,
and then interrupted by means of a shutter, making dots
and dashes as used in the Morse telegraph code. This system
is used only when operations ashore are going on, as the
rolling of the ship would prevent the concentration of the
sun’s rays.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The present systems of flag signalling are products of
experience in the past, and are the natural growth of the
cruder flag system in use during the War of 1812, and in
the Civil War. There have been some changes in the construction
of flags, and the scope of communication has been
enlarged, but otherwise our forefathers talked at sea in much
the same way as we do now. Of course the Ardois light
signal is something very modern. In old times they communicated
at night either with coloured lights or by torches,
and, as there was no alphabetical code in those days, the
process was by means of flashes (representing numbers in
the signal book), and it was long and tedious.

where, low down on the shore, there seems to be a slight
opening in the rocky coast, above which stands, apparently,
some dwelling-house. However, time tells, and in a half
hour more we discover the small opening to be the entrance
to a valley, and the dwelling-house to be the fort of the
Cabanas. Still, no town and no harbour; and yet ahead
we see, high upon a rocky cliff, a queer-looking old castle,
with guns frowning from its embrasures, and its variegated
walls looking as if they were ready to fall into the waves
dashing at their base. That is the Morro Castle, which,
with the battery of Aguadores, the battery of the Estrella,
and the above named Cabanas, commands the approaches
to the harbour and town of Cuba.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The rocky shore above and below the castle has scattered
along it the remains of several vessels, whose captains,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in trying to escape from the dangers of the storm, have
vainly sought to enter the difficult harbour, and the bleaching
timbers are sad warnings to the mariner not to enter
there except in the proper kind of weather. And now we
are up to the castle, and a sharp turn to the left takes us
into a narrow channel and past the Morro and the battery
adjoining, whose sentry, with a trumpet as big as himself,
hails our vessel as she goes by; and soon we find ourselves
in a gradually enlarging bay, around which the mountains
are seen in every direction. As yet we have seen no town,
and no place where there will likely be one; but now a turn
to the right, and there, rising from the water’s side almost to
the top of the mountains, is seen Santiago de Cuba, with its
red roofs, tall cathedral towers, and the green trees of
its pretty Paseo, lighted up by the evening sun, forming a
brilliant foreground to the hazy blue mountains that lie
behind the city....</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“Rising gradually from the bay, upon the mountainside,
to the high plain called the Campo del Marte, the city of
Santiago reaches in its highest point 160 feet above the
level of the sea, and commands from almost any portion
superb views of the bay at its feet and of the majestic
ranges of mountains that surround it. With a population
of about fifty thousand inhabitants, it has regularly laid out
streets and well-built houses of stone in most portions of
the city; though being built as it is on the side of a hill,
many of the streets are very steep in their ascent, and from
the constant washing of the rains, and the absence of side-walks,
are anything but an agreeable promenade.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    <span class="tei tei-q">“The town was founded in 1515, by Diego Velasquez, considered
the conqueror of the island, who landed here in that
year on his first voyage; and it was from here that Juan de
Grijalva, in 1518, started on his expedition for the conquest
of Yucatan, being followed by Hernando Cortes, who,
how<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ever, was compelled to stop at Havana (as it was called
then), now Batabano. In 1522 the distinctions of <span class="tei tei-q">‘City’</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">‘Bishopric’</span> were bestowed upon the town, having
been taken from the older town of Baracoa, where they had
been bestowed in honour of that place being the first European
settlement; and in 1527 Fr. Miguel Ramirez de Salamanca,

arquebusiers, who took possession of it until a ransom of
$80,000 was paid, the invaders remaining nearly a month in
the city, and as late as 1592, so frequent were the attacks
of pirates on this town, that it is related the place was almost
depopulated by the inhabitants taking refuge at Bayamo,
some distance in the interior.</span>

    <span class="tei tei-q">“In 1608, the cathedral having been ruined by an earthquake,
the Bishop Lalcedo removed his residence to Havana,

to curse and stone his house.</span>

people landed at the place now known as the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Aguadores,’</span>
and to the number of eight hundred men marched without
opposition on the city, of which they took possession, after
repulsing a small force sent out to meet them. The invaders,
it appears, partook freely of the church-bells, carried
off the guns from the forts, took charge of the slaves, and
not finding the valuables they anticipated, which had been
carried off by the retreating inhabitants, they, in their disappointment,
blew up the Morro Castle, and destroyed the
cathedral, remaining nearly a month in possession of the
city.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

in corroboration of this fact, that on the 26th of November,
1810, on digging in the cemetery of the new cathedral, the
broken slab of his tomb was found, seven and a half feet

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">PORTO RICO.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Porto Rico was discovered by Columbus in November,
1493. In 1510 Ponce de Leon founded the town
of Caparra, soon after abandoned, and now known as Pureto
Viejo, and in 1511, with more success, the city of San Juan
Bautista, or better known simply as San Juan. The native
inhabitants were soon subdued and swept away. In 1595
the capital was sacked by Drake, and in 1598 by the Earl
of Cumberland. In 1615 Baldwin Heinrich, a Dutchman,
lost his life in an attack on the Castello del <a name="corr383" id="corr383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Morro</span>. The
attempt of the English, in 1678, was equally unsuccessful,
and Abercrombie, in 1797, had to retire after a three
days’ strife. In 1820 a movement was made toward the
declaration of independence on the part of the Porto
Ricans, but Spanish supremacy was completely reëstablished
by 1823. The last traces of slavery were abolished
in 1873.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
San Juan is the ideal city and spot of the whole island,
saving that it is well fortified, for it is the coolest, the
healthiest port, with thirty-eight feet of water in the harbour,
and twenty-eight feet of water alongside the coal wharves.
It is the only port on the island with fortifications. There
are barracks in a few of the larger towns, but outside of the
eight thousand or ten thousand troops there are very few
fighting men on the island.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The volunteers are not looked upon as a great factor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in fighting by those who know them, and are almost all
Spaniards. The Guardia Civil is made up of the best of
the Spanish army, and commands great respect. The Porto
Rican civilians do not have to enter the army service unless
they please, and very few of them please.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The defences of San Juan are good. San Felippe del
Morro fortress is at the entrance of the harbour. It is
the principal defence from the sea, and has three rows of
batteries. It is separated by a strong wall from the city,
which lies at the back of it, but communication between the
city and fort is had by a tunnel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The roads of Porto Rico are, for the most part, bad.
There are some notable exceptions. There is a splendid
road built by the Spanish government from Ponce to San
Juan. It is about eighty-five miles long, and a young Porto
Rican told the writer that he frequently went over it on his
bicycle, and it was splendid all the way. Another road
from Guayama, meeting the Ponce road at Cayey, has been
recently finished. The scenery is the most beautiful in the
West Indies, for tropical wild flowers are all over the
island, and large tree ferns and magnificent plants everywhere
abound. There are no venomous snakes nor wild
animals of any kind in Porto Rico. Oranges and other
tropical fruits thrive in Porto Rico, but they are not specially
cultivated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some years ago a railway around the island was projected,
but only three sections have been built. There is one to
the north from San Juan to Camuy, one on the west from
Aguadilla to Mayaguez, and one on the south from Yauco
to Ponce. Any one wishing to travel around the coast from
San Juan to Ponce would be obliged to continue their
journey by stage-coaches, one from Camuy to Aguadilla,
and one from Mayaguez to Yauco.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
San Juan has about forty thousand inhabitants, and Ponce
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>has almost thirty thousand. There are many towns of
between twelve thousand and thirty thousand people. The
buildings are low and are of wood. There are a few three-story
buildings in Ponce, and these are the latest examples
of modern construction.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the extreme southeastern coast of Cuba, some distance
east of Santiago, is Guantanamo, or Cumberland
Bay. It is an exceedingly beautiful sheet of water, with a
narrow entrance, guarded by high hills. It extends twelve
miles inland, with a level coast-line to the westward, and
high hills on the north and east.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Five miles from the entrance is the little town of
Caimanera, from which runs a railroad to the town of
Guantanamo, twelve miles distant, with its terminus at the
town of Jamaica. There are two and one-half square miles
of anchorage, with a depth of forty feet, so far inside as to
be fully protected from the wind. For vessels drawing
twenty-four feet or less there are about two more square
miles of harbourage.
